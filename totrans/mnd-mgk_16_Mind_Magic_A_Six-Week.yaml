- en: As I noted in the introduction, I have placed this final section, about the
    practices I set out previously, into a step-by-step program. It is designed to
    guide you through the manifesting process. As you proceed, I suggest you keep
    a specific journal to record your observations, frustrations, progress, doubts,
    and insights. If it is possible for you in your life circumstances, you may also
    benefit from setting aside a room or particular area of your home where you can
    explore these techniques in peace and without disturbance. You might put up quotations
    that inspire you or images that remind you of your goals, or create a personal
    altar to focus your mind and give you a sense of support. Or you can set aside
    a specific time each day, say first thing in the morning, and do your practice
    at that time. This will prime your brain to be responsive to the practices.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you already have a meditation practice, the techniques I am suggesting can
    fit right into it. You might try incorporating one of the visualizations as you
    sit, or meditating before you do a writing practice. If you don’t already meditate,
    there are countless resources available for cultivating a practice, including
    many free guided sessions available online. A meditation or contemplative practice
    is not essential for manifesting, but the two support each other in many ways,
    from increased relaxation to mental clarity to the boost of self-worth that comes
    from discipline to the softening of the heart around challenges to deepening the
    sense that everything is OK no matter what happens.

- en: Some people may find it helpful to read through this program in its entirety
    to get a sense of what is to come. Others may prefer to focus only on whatever
    step they are on and not rush ahead. Either way, I recommend following this program
    in order, as the steps build on each other, each one opening the possibility of
    and establishing the resources for the next. If you are struggling with a particular
    step, try returning to the practice in the previous step until it is firmly established,
    as this will help what is to come arise more naturally and without effort.

    fear when starting these practices. The most important thing is to set your intention
    to manifest your vision and begin your habit of practicing even in very small
    doses. Remember what we discussed earlier about beginning with small habits.

    to examine your life as it is today, in all its imperfection—and, maybe, glory.
    Appreciate that you have already been manifesting your intention in some form,
    however imperfectly. Understand that you now have the tools and insights that
    will allow you to increase the likelihood of manifesting things that will improve
    your life and the lives of others around you. Also appreciate that you now understand
    that you have the power to purposefully influence the circumstances of your life,
    down to the minute details. It may be humbling or discouraging to take a clear-eyed
    account of the life you have made, but the information you collect will be invaluable
    when you start to reflect on what you would like to manifest. Trust that you can
    start exactly where you are.

    circumstances, without any judgment. As you uncover the aspects of your life you
    are already manifesting, you will discover the places from which you may be withholding
    your inner power. Don’t worry about changing anything right now. All you need
    to do is offer a kind and clear awareness.

    read it over when they are waiting in line. You can make a recording of yourself
    reading it and play it when you wake up or before you go to sleep. You may even
    be inspired to create a visual representation of it, either a collage of images
    from a magazine or a drawing or painting. Share it with friends and ask them to
    remind you of it periodically. You can repeat this practice as many times as you

    Remember that the brain is designed to keep you alive, not keep you happy. Any
    new direction, no matter how inspiring or enlivening or potent or heartfelt, will
    inevitably evoke the nervous system’s resistance. Your job is not to fight this
    resistance but to soothe it, coexist with it, and even collaborate with it. The
    most effective way to respond is to cultivate a sense of self-compassion. Although
    it may feel buried and inaccessible, the ability to relate to suffering with kindness
    is a natural capacity installed in us biologically. With practice, you will learn
    to open your heart to your own experience, no matter the content. In time, resistance
    will diminish and enthusiasm will increase.

    by visualizing it and accompanying it with a strongly felt positive emotion. The

    you experience in your imagination. So, the more vivid you can make your mental

    the good, and softens frustration and disappointment. It increases our generosity

    beauty, kindness, and abundance we already have, it is easier to let go of our
    attachment to a particular outcome occurring at a particular time. We are free
