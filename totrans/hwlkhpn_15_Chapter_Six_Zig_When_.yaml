    Growing up in Alaska as the oldest of five children, he was mostly self-taught
    and spent a lot of time in the outdoors. (You can learn a lot watching salmon
    swim upstream.) The first time he stepped into a real classroom was when he arrived
    at college.

    high schools his freshman year at Harvard to find out. “I realized that I was
    lucky to have been able to follow my own interests and learn how to solve problems
    for myself,” he told me one morning. “When everyone else was on the main road
    with a standard curriculum, I was on a side street and getting my own view.”

    Spring Harbor Laboratory. Though close to ninety, Dr. Watson remains vigorous
    and outspoken. He wanted to be a professional ornithologist when he was young
    (a passion he shares with Barnaby), but he took up the emerging field of genetics
    when he was a student in graduate school. He had strong opinions and a curious
    mind and was definitely not a go-with-the-flow guy. The willingness to think in
    completely new directions helped Dr. Watson back in 1953 when he discovered (along
    with Francis Crick) the structure of DNA. It was one of the greatest scientific
    breakthroughs of the century and led to his winning a Nobel Prize.

    of life came from always pushing forward in new directions, even if it was sometimes
    in opposition to what most around him believed.

    can make luck outside the laboratory, too. Back when I was a television producer,
    I worked with a network executive named Mike Darnell, who was one of the most
    daring people I’d ever met. Smart, innovative, and creative, he had more cutting-edge
    ideas in a day than most people have in a year. And he didn’t care how off-the-wall
    or unusual they were, or how much his bosses bristled when he proposed them. In
    a business where everybody imitates each other, Darnell made a career of being
    a complete original.

    liked to wear jeans and cowboy boots (though he’d stopped wearing the matching
    hat). Back when we worked together, you could tell it was a really important day

    came to Hollywood to pitch a show, none of the other networks’ executives would
    take a meeting with him. Darnell eagerly met with him—and, excited by Fuller’s
    idea, bought his show as a summer replacement. Darnell had seen similar shows
    that aired in the United Kingdom and instinctively knew that he wanted this one—called
    *American Idol.*[*](44_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1) Yup, Darnell was the guy who

    emulate. “In real life, I don’t like roller coasters or scary rides and I take
    no risks. I don’t even like change. I’m married to the same wife, and I stayed

    Darnell knew that he wasn’t the obvious guy to get lucky in the intense, image-driven

    to forge a different path. He had to zig when others zagged.

- en: In setting out on a jagged path, Darnell unwittingly undertook a strategy that
    researchers call “systematic unpredictability.” Charles Darwin would have seen
    the value of Darnell’s approach, at least theoretically, since it turns out that
    evolution may favor people and species that take unusual paths. British biologists
    P. M. Driver and D. A. Humphries spent three decades studying animal behavior
    and figured out that doing the unexpected is one of the best survival skills around.
    In one of their early studies, they simply tracked rabbits as they raced across
    a field and noticed how they made quick and nimble changes of direction. This
    behavior is called “jinking,” and the biologists originally thought that it was
    done specifically to dodge a predator. But then they realized that the twists
    and turns are different every time and take place even when the furry little rabbit
    isn’t being pursued.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Taking an unexpected path even when there’s nobody on your tail gives you a
    leg (or paw) up when there *is* a predator around. Basically, it works so well
    that it has become an innate behavior in many species. The biologists call this
    “single erratic display,” and they’ve observed it in rabbits and squirrels and
    songbirds and snipes and mullet and eels and waders and many, many others. They
    described one bird called the black-tailed godwit that will display “a quick ascending
    flight . . . alternating with steep dives inclusive of leaf-scattering and quick
    zig-zag flight low over the ground, often with sudden changes of flying direction.”
    Whew. Now that’s *definitely* being different. If you’re unpredictable, you’re
    less likely to get caught and more likely to survive—and there’s nothing luckier
    than staying alive. So natural selection seems to have favored the animals, including
    us, who learned how to zigzag through life.

    his luck (and survival) even early in his career. When he first started out, he

    to work at the network and ended it with: “Either Mike’s career or this tape will
    self-destruct in five seconds.” He showed up at an event that he knew Diller would

    in sync—and specifically how crickets synchronize their chirps. His then PhD student
    Duncan Watts began talking with him about the six degrees of separation theory.
    You probably know the research—or at least the concept—suggesting any two people
    in the world can be connected through a small number of links. Back in 1967, the
    psychologist Stanley Milgram famously found that it took just five intermediaries
    to get a package from a random person in Omaha, Nebraska, to a stockbroker in
    Boston. Since then, other researchers have tried similar experiments online that
    allow bigger samples (and save on postage). They’ve gotten roughly the same results.

    be nuts to head down it. Everyone except Strogatz. He thinks revisiting dead ends
    can be a productive strategy in many fields, including business and academics.
    “Think about the problem again, or have a young person think about it, because
    they won’t be stuck in the traditional way of thinking that got you to the dead

    team doesn’t always know how to line up against them. So when they’re close to

    football and basketball teams, so he decided to try the high jump. Unfortunately,
    he wasn’t too impressive at that, either. Though he was six-foot-four, he could
    barely clear five feet four inches. In those days, high jumpers got over the bar
    with either a scissors kick (one leg and then the other) or a straddle. He tried
    both styles of jumping, but neither made him a winner. Then at one meet, he decided
    to improvise something completely different. If he couldn’t win in the normal
    fashion, maybe he’d have luck going over the bar—well, backward. He did his takeoff
    and rotated in the air—and soared over the bar. In a sport where success is counted
    in quarter-inch increments, he went an amazing six inches higher than his previous
    best.

    experts warned that he’d never achieve anything with his backward style. Sports
    journalists went out of their way to find sneering metaphors to describe his technique,
    one describing him as looking like a guy falling off the back of a truck and another
    invoking the image of a fish flopping on the bottom of a boat. But Fosbury ignored

    pyramids at Teotihuacán with two friends and stayed there all night. In the following
    days, while his teammates went out to practice, Fosbury often stayed behind or
    tried just a few jumps. Some thought he was slacking, but he knew himself and
    realized that more practices wouldn’t help. He needed the rush of competition
    to do his best. Then came the actual high jump competition, and the naysayers
    were caught up short. Over two days in Olympic stadium, Fosbury didn’t miss a
    single jump. He won the gold medal with a new Olympic record of 7.35 feet (2.24
    meters)—flopping his way to glory.

    Fosbury’s backward jump meant that after he went over the bar, he hit the mat
    neck first. The (tradition-bound) Olympic team coach warned that if kids tried
    to imitate Fosbury, it would “wipe out an entire generation of high jumpers, because
    they will all have broken necks.” The kids did copy him and (happily) all necks
    stayed intact. Soon the Fosbury Flop was the only style any high jumper used.
