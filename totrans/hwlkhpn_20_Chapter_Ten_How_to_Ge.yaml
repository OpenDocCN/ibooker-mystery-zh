- en: Barnaby regularly insisted that our principles of luck had to be “robust”—a
    word that always made me think of a chubby, red-cheeked toddler. But in science
    lingo, it means the rules can hold up in most circumstances. The term is adapted
    from computer programmers who use it to ensure that their coding will work even
    if there are errors during input—and you probably don’t want to get too deeply
    into this lingo, because then you find out about fuzz testing, which involves
    putting in random data and seeing if it crashes the whole program.
  prefs: []

    the principles—from being attentive to zigging when others zagged—were definitely
    robust. They could get you through anything.

    work in everyday situations. Making yourself lucky in a theoretical sense is nice—but
    it’s a lot better if you can get lucky in the areas that really count, like love,
    work, and family.

- en: Barnaby told me a funny story about the go-getters who apply to be first-year
    analysts at Goldman Sachs. Most are at the top of their game and the top of their
    class (at an Ivy League school, preferably), and with so many high-level people
    competing, any little edge can make a difference. So they write carefully crafted
    cover letters, deliberate about whether their résumé should be in Helvetica or
    Arial font, and look for the bon mot that will make them stand out.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One year, the Goldman Sachs managing director who was overseeing recruiting
    piled all the résumés of potential analysts on his desk, then divided them into
    two smaller stacks. He deliberated for a moment—and then tossed one of the stacks
    into the wastebasket.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    have to be lucky in this business,” he said. Then pointing to the résumés still
    on his desk, he added, “We might as well pick from the lucky ones.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    around being subject to the laws of randomness. I asked Barnaby if this tale was
    really true or just Wall Street legend.

- en: If you have ever applied for a job or spent time trying to build a career, you
    know that randomness seems to determine outcomes more than seems fair. Your future
    and fate may depend on whether the human resources person has a headache the morning
    she meets you or whether the executive who interviews you played squash at the
    same college you did. A whimsical executive tossing out résumés just to make a
    point seems like it’s all part of the game.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The story got us thinking. If you’re trying to make your own luck (as we’ve
    been describing all along), how can you possibly make sure that your résumé ends
    up in the pile that stays on the desk? Once we’d posed the question to ourselves,
    we spent some time batting it around. Had we finally hit on an example where the
    randomness, which you can’t control, was the operating force in luck, well beyond
    the other elements that you can control, like talent and hard work?
  prefs: []

    stays on the desk,” I said worriedly.

    immediately brightening up. “So you don’t want to be in one of those piles at
    all!”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Aha! The managing director at Goldman Sachs was right that you’re going to need
    luck to get a job—but remember that the luck we’ve been describing comes at the
    intersection of chance, talent, and hard work. The whimsical decision to toss
    away half the résumés is a perfect example of random chance. If you’re in the
    wrong pile, there’s nothing you can do. And while you can’t remove random chance
    from life (unless you do have those magical powers), you have to be prepared to
    work around it. You can’t always anticipate the unexpected, but you can focus
    on elements that *are* in your control, and thus make chance less . . . chancy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let’s say you’re applying for that job at Goldman Sachs. The trick is to
    make sure that your résumé ends up in a *third* stack—a small selection that the
    managing director has already pulled and knows he’ll look at and consider.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, it may seem like we’re working backward here—because when you’re applying,
    you can’t possibly know that the managing director is going to do something so
    random. But whether you’re in the year of the lucky-versus-unlucky résumé piles
    or not, it’s a good bet that a basic résumé, even one set in Helvetica and accompanied
    by a brilliant cover letter, won’t be enough to get you hired. Standard techniques
    rarely work in a hypercompetitive environment. You need something that will make
    you stand out from the beginning so that your résumé isn’t in either of the stacks
    on his deck.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One approach is to imagine the person who would definitely be lucky in this
    situation. You can, for example, figure that if some top-level executive had a
    child applying for the Goldman Sachs job, he’d call the CEO directly and make
    sure that his prodigy’s résumé was at least seen. Instead of stomping around and
    complaining about how unfair it all is, you can figure out how that example applies
    to you. Assuming your family ties lean more toward plumbers and accountants and
    sales reps than investment bankers, what’s the best next step?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Clearly you need to find somebody else who can pick up the phone and make that
    call for you. And that’s not as hard as it sounds. Don’t worry about what your
    mom and dad can (or can’t) do for you. Remember that sociologists have shown that
    luck doesn’t always, or even usually, come from the people closest to you. You
    need to rely on the strength of weak ties.

- en: Barnaby had come across an executive coach named Don Asher who has written a
    dozen books on how to get a job, so we tracked him down to get his advice on the
    topic. He said that you’re most likely to find the person who can make that call
    if you “cross the boundaries of the bubble where you normally live. You miss a
    lot of luck if you interact only with your own friends.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Asher told us about one client who was in retail sales and wanted to break into
    the fashion business. He told her to ask everyone she encountered if they knew
    anyone in the field. “She was in the gym with her personal trainer, Helga, and
    told her the situation—and it turned out that one of Helga’s clients was the vice-president
    of finance for a major designer,” said Asher. Connection made.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We called two other career coaches, and it turned out that the Helga story wasn’t
    an anomaly. People such as hairdressers and personal trainers—whose professions
    naturally let them cross boundaries—are unexpectedly good sources for luck. Know
    specifically what you’re asking for, and you can trigger a lucky connection while
    you’re taking a hip-hop dance class or getting a layered bob with blond highlights.

- en: One of the strongest of the weak ties often turns out to be college alumni connections.
    It’s hard to say exactly why the fact that you attended Notre Dame rather than
    Penn State should make someone want to talk with you—but it works. Psychologists
    have shown over and over that people form tribal allegiances over often insignificant
    ties. Give half a group red T-shirts and the other half blue ones, and all of
    a sudden people are fiercely loyal to their colormates. They’ll be more likely
    to lend them money and cooperate with them in games.

    Turning that instinct on its head and using group identification for positive
    purposes seems like the very least we can do to start balancing the scale. So
    if you’re applying for that job at Goldman Sachs (or elsewhere), check out LinkedIn
    or your college alumni directory and find someone at a high level at the company
    who attended your college.

    named Tyler who told me that he spent much of his senior year in college trying

    recruiting and put his résumé into the school’s career directory.

    kind of job he wanted, and when luck didn’t naturally come his way, he made the
    luck for himself. The fact that Tyler and the alum played the same position and
    wore the same number was definitely a bit of random chance. But Tyler then had
    to capture the luck by being skillful enough to recognize the opportunity and
    find a creative way to pursue it. Chance, talent, and effort—and bingo, you seem

    as if they’re stealing an advantage they don’t really deserve. And sometimes it
    can make you feel a little queasy. When the HBO show *Girls* was first announced,
    I remember being a little taken aback by the cast. Creator Lena Dunham had selected
    three women to costar with her, and two of them—Allison Williams and Zosia Mamet—had
    famous parents and the third, Jemima Kirke, was Dunham’s high school friend.[*](59_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1)
    All were talented, but I kept thinking about all the equally talented young actresses
    who didn’t have their edge. I pictured rows of young actresses standing in line
    for their audition, not knowing the odds were stacked against them. It didn’t
    seem fair.

    and Kirke so defined their characters that it was impossible to think of anybody
    else in their roles. Mamet continued honing her skills, and I went to see her
    in an off-Broadway play in which she was stunningly good. And that’s when I realized—connections

    block the path for others. In terms of social mobility and possibilities for everyone,
    we need to think about ways to distribute opportunities equitably in work and
    finance and entertainment. And some people are doing exactly that. My friend Julian
    Johnson is the executive vice-president of Sponsors for Educational Opportunity
    (SEO), a nonprofit that offers career programs for students from underserved communities.
    If you want that job at Goldman Sachs but come from a poor town in southern Alabama,

    of minority students land jobs in finance and law and investment banking.

    students at small schools, for example, might not have any obvious route to Wall
    Street since investment banks usually offer jobs to students from only a few select
    colleges. But SEO makes the network much wider. You provide the hard work and
    determination—and they’ll make sure you get the opportunities to connect with
    the right people.[*](61_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_3) When Julian and I spoke, SEO
    had students from 105 different colleges about to start in summer internships.
    That’s a large number of schools. SEO was opening lucky doors for a lot of people—and
    they expected that 80 percent of the interns would get full-time offers.

    study and work hard. That might have paid off in grades K–12, but in the real
    world, it’s no longer enough. Instead of keeping your head down and expecting
    the work to speak for itself, you need to find mentors and advisors and sponsors
    who will help you advance. Julian told me that the SEO teams stay with the students
    after they get the internships to help them understand how to ascend within the
    company—“because your network becomes your net worth.”

    now—at least in part because he knows that he’s the guy who sometimes delivers
    it. As the head of DRG, an executive search firm that deals mostly with nonprofit
    organizations, he has placed more than a thousand top executives in their jobs.

    you may not want to move), and sometimes they’re just uncomfortable with change.

    whether to even have the conversation.” Then there’s the third group—“the people
    who listen and say, ‘Great. I wasn’t expecting your call, but I’m in.’”

    do going forward. The naysayers in the first group usually won’t work out even
    if they change their mind and decide to pursue the opportunity. Those in the second
    group who ask a lot of questions may be thoughtful and analytic—and David appreciates
    that. But he’s also careful to see if they’re the kind of people who will continue
    to throw obstacles in the way and find reasons not to go ahead. Those in the third
    group are most likely to be successful at recognizing new and lucky opportunities—but
    he wants to be sure that they’re not reckless.

    as a fund raiser, knew he was persuasive and good on his feet, and recommended
    him. “So I went to the Acapulco Princess in Mexico for five days with my wife
    and did sales training for a $75 million watch company. Courageous? Okay, yes.

    in school and attended a campus talk by the president of an online-payments company.
    Zach went up to the executive afterward, said how much he admired the company,
    and asked if they could get together. The president agreed to a meeting—but just
    to give advice and information. He didn’t have any openings for a student with
    Zach’s background.

    he also listened carefully. As the president described how they were trying to
    reach customers, Zach offered an idea on how collecting and analyzing a certain
    kind of data might be helpful. The president nodded thoughtfully. He hadn’t thought
    about that approach before—and he asked if Zach might be able to do it.

    with your would-be boss and solving a problem for him. Having something very specific
    to offer changes an answer from “can’t use you” to “can you start this afternoon?”
    Working at this very cool company looked to Zach’s friends like the ultimate in
    good luck. But it was luck that he had made.

    to make luck by going in their own direction. Sometimes the best way to end up
    in the third stack is to be in a spot where those first two stacks don’t even
    exist. Or as a very successful friend of ours put it, “People always talk about
    thinking outside the box. I never even knew the box existed.”

    keep getting lower (you can now create a company with a laptop instead of a factory).
    So abandoning standard career paths and making your own trail isn’t crazy—it could
    be one way of entering the good luck club.

    of going her own way and creating luck. In her mid-twenties, she was already a
    serial entrepreneur. So one afternoon we headed over to the offices of the Gerson
    Lehrman Group (GLG), where she sometimes works. It was one of those super-chic
    spaces where you immediately feel that everyone around must be cooler than you.
    The front area featured red and orange chairs in a flex space, an upside-down
    fish tank, and hanging lights in the shape of brass globes. Behind the cool spaces
    were rows and rows of people on computers.

    and a beguiling style, she could have easily passed for a high school cheerleader.
    But she’s not and never was. When we sat down at a corner table, Kantar quickly
    admitted that she’s always been an original, going in her own direction. She surprised
    everyone a few years ago when she decided to drop out of Harvard after her sophomore
    year. She considered it a good way to get lucky.

    of Harvard dropout (and Facebook founder) Mark Zuckerberg.

    raise the average,” Kantar said. She liked to see herself in their mode. She too
    wanted to be an original who took big risks and looked very lucky when they paid
    off. When she was at Harvard, she hadn’t felt inspired by her classes and didn’t
    see where her degree would lead.

    I said I didn’t want one. She also worried about what would happen if I eventually
    wanted to go into politics. I said that my generation would like to see someone
    who had done something interesting rather than just what’s expected.”

    Newton, Massachusetts, she took Chinese, got obsessed with origami, and played
    the trumpet. For her bat mitzvah, she took her friends snow tubing (“I hated dance
    parties”), and later in middle school, she started asking her (baffled) parents
    for a donkey.

    I liked donkeys,” Kantar said with a smile.

    home wasn’t zoned for farm animals. Kantar was too young to drive, so she walked
    over to city hall one afternoon and filed a petition for rezoning. She got it.
    (But she still didn’t get the donkey.)
  prefs: []

- en: The donkey story pretty much summed up Kantar’s attitude. Go after things that
    are different. In high school, she didn’t want to take the standard classes and
    asked to devise her own curriculum. The school said no. So she wrote to the deans
    of the Ivy League schools where she had applied and said she wanted to quit her
    AP classes and do an independent study project for the rest of the year. What
    did they think of that? Most of them responded that it would be just fine. Rebecca
    spent the rest of senior year outside the classroom. “It was the best academic
    experience I had,” she said.

    which connected young entrepreneurs with corporations and investors who could
    use their insights. The idea was that the younger group knew about innovations
    that might upend the traditional models.

    be Facebook. But eventually GLG made an offer to buy it. GLG has become hugely

    their information. They were really buying Rebecca’s brain—and gave her the title
    of entrepreneur in residence.

    is most important for success.

    conference of innovators that Kantar told him she wanted to attend. He made inquiries
    with the organizers on her behalf, and when she didn’t get one of the coveted
    invitations, she still found a way get inside. I was impressed. Even though Kantar
    looked like a cheerleader, she apparently had the ferocity and intensity of a
    Navy SEAL. When she had a mission, she didn’t let anything get in her way.

    Sometimes it pays off big, and sometimes it doesn’t. Yet failing isn’t always
    a bad thing. Barnaby told me about a conversation he had with Naveen Jain, the
    entrepreneur who founded a company called InfoSpace in the late 1990s. It was
    briefly one of the largest internet companies in the country—making Jain worth
    some $8 billion. Then came the dot-com crash and a series of lawsuits, and suddenly
    his stake was more in the $200 million range.

    luck and bad luck, which are going to be coming in the future.”

    once these are analyzed, they may not be as dramatic as they seem. In his view,
    for example, having a private company try to get to the moon wasn’t crazy at all.

    failure is not a political option. The last 1 percent of the risk abatement adds
    99 percent of the cost,” he said. A private company can make the unmanned rocket
    “good enough”—then buy private insurance to cover the cost if something goes wrong.
    Jain sees that as a metaphor for how to lead other pursuits.

    Rebecca Kantar are probably the types who would climb on Jain’s spaceship and
    see where it took them. I’m not sure I would. I’m willing to get lucky through
    making the right connections, working hard, and taking opportunities, but I’m
    not a big risk taker. Some people will probably get a lot luckier with a willingness
    to try a completely unknown approach.

    So, for example, Barnaby didn’t drop out of college like Kantar did, but he did
    switch universities several times, moving from Harvard to Cornell to a year of
    research at Oxford. (He actually planned it all, wanting to work with the world-renowned
    ornithology professors at each.) Later, he wanted to win a Rhodes scholarship
    to return to Oxford and needed to be endorsed by his school. Cornell initially
    said they couldn’t support him because he didn’t have enough credits on their
    campus. Barnaby went higher and higher in the administration, finally banging
    on the president’s door. He figures that he contacted close to fifty people in
    various capacities to get support for his application.

    at Goldman Sachs, you get lucky when you make your own path. Sure, some randomness
    can come into play. But you’ll expect that ahead of time and do everything to
    work around it. You’ll put yourself in the third résumé stack—instead of one of
    the others that might be tossed away. You’ll speak to the right people, find your
    own direction, and be willing to stand out. It won’t work every time—and you might
    get a chance to learn from your failures—but when it does, you’ll look very, very
    lucky.
