    we all drifted over to the table, which had been set up for dessert. As we tucked
    into fruit and gelato (and chocolate cookies, let’s admit), one of the women said
    she had an announcement. Her husband had a friend who used to work with a talented
    guy in the digital world who just got fired and needed a new job. Did anybody

    surprised to find out that Barnaby knew him, since Sree clearly had a huge network.
    How else would an Indian journalist who was born in Tokyo end up being discussed
    by a bunch of women in an Upper East Side book group? When I checked out his story,
    Sree turned out to be the perfect example of Barnaby’s next principle—that you
    make luck through other people.

  zh: 需要找工作的那个人叫Sree Sreenivasan——我本不该对Barnaby认识他感到惊讶，因为Sree显然有着庞大的社交网络。否则，一个在东京出生的印度记者怎么会在上东区的一个书友会中被一群女性讨论呢？当我了解他的故事后，发现Sree正是Barnaby下一个原则的完美例子——你是通过他人创造幸运的。
- en: 'Sree was already well-known in the social media world when he was hired as
    the first chief digital officer of the Metropolitan Museum of Art—a position created
    just for him. He considered it a dream job. But after three years, the Met decided
    to cut back top staff, and in June 2016, he was let go. He said later that his
    first reaction was panic, and he thought about retreating. Climbing into a hole
    is a natural reaction when you’re down, but unless you’re a badger, holes don’t
    lead anywhere. So he decided to use his many friends and followers on social media
    for support. He announced his situation on Facebook and said that he usually walked
    for five miles every day—and now that he had more time, it would be ten miles.
    He invited people to sign up to walk and talk with him, and he put up a form that
    read: “If there’s one thing Sree should consider doing next it is . . .” Some
    1,300 people reached out to him in what he called a “global digital hug.” He was
    apparently being discussed everywhere—including at my book club. By the end of
    the month, he had a new job as chief digital officer for the City of New York—a
    much bigger job than where he had been.'

  zh: 当Sree被聘为大都会艺术博物馆的首任首席数字官时，他已经在社交媒体界广为人知——这个职位是专门为他设立的。他认为这是梦想中的工作。但三年后，大都会决定缩减高级职员，2016年6月，他被解雇了。他后来表示，自己最初的反应是恐慌，想着要退缩。当你处于低谷时，往洞里钻是很自然的反应，但除非你是獾，否则洞是不会带你去任何地方的。于是他决定利用自己在社交媒体上的众多朋友和关注者寻求支持。他在Facebook上宣布了自己的处境，并说自己每天通常会走五英里——而现在有了更多时间，应该走十英里。他邀请大家报名一起走路并与他交谈，并贴出了一张表单，上面写着：“如果有一件事Sree应该考虑接下来做的，那就是……”。大约1,300人联系了他，给了他他所称之为的“全球数字拥抱”。显然，他在各地都被讨论着——包括在我的书友会里。到月末时，他已找到了新工作，成为纽约市的首席数字官——这比他之前的工作要大得多。
- en: Sree’s good luck revolved around using his connections—and his extended network—in
    a very public way. When his new position was announced, he posted, “I got this
    role because I was open and frank and asked for help. I think the more we are
    all clear about the help we need, the more that people can help us.”

- en: It’s probably fair to say that more often than not, luck depends on other people.
    Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig has argued that the more interconnected
    we are, the more creative and innovative we become.[*](41_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1)
    Expanding on this idea, writer Steven Johnson points out in his book *Where Good
    Ideas Come From* that during the Renaissance, breakthroughs arose from “the inventive
    genius, the rogue visionary who somehow sees beyond the horizon that limits his
    contemporaries—da Vinci, Copernicus, Galileo.” But after 1800, there was a huge
    change, and now most innovation occurs in collaborative environments. Rather than
    sitting alone at a desk and hoping for a eureka moment, most creative people are
    sharing ideas and building on one another’s work. Executives and investors are
    talking to one another about possibilities. In our more networked world, working
    with other people creates luck.

  zh: 可能可以公平地说，运气往往依赖于他人。哈佛法学院教授劳伦斯·莱西格（Lawrence Lessig）曾主张，我们之间的联系越多，我们就越有创造力和创新性[*](41_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1)。在此基础上，作家史蒂文·约翰逊（Steven
    Johnson）在他的书《好点子从哪里来》中指出，在文艺复兴时期，突破性发现往往源自“具有创造天才的、顽固的远见者，他们能看到超越当代人视野的东西——如达·芬奇、哥白尼、伽利略”。但1800年后，发生了巨大的变化，现在大多数创新都发生在合作环境中。与其独自坐在书桌前，期待灵感的瞬间，大多数创造性的人都在分享想法，并在彼此的工作基础上进行拓展。高管和投资者们也在相互交流可能性。在我们这个更加互联的世界里，与他人合作创造了运气。
- en: A simple secret of luck is to be with the people who can (and will) cause good
    things to happen for you. And it’s not always who you think. Family and friends

    and Harvard and is now a chaired professor of sociology at Stanford, refers to
    this as “the strength of weak ties.”[*](42_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_2) You have
    strong ties with people like close friends or colleagues whom you see at least
    once a week and weak ties with those you encounter less frequently. Interestingly,
    it’s the weak ties that usually matter, whether you’re looking to land a potential
    mate or a new job in digital media. You and your best friends already know most
    of the same people—you have “overlapping social circles,” as the sociologists
    like to say. But those with whom you’re more weakly tied—like Sree and the ladies
    at the book club—probably have an entirely different social network. Connecting
    with them opens up a whole new community of possibilities—and because each new
    person is connected to many others, your possibilities are suddenly vastly larger.

    of networks at conferences she runs. A consultant to many nonprofit organizations,
    she organizes luck circles instead of the standard bonding exercises that many
    of us have come to dread (beach Olympics, anyone?). Barnaby and I met Lara at
    a local café for breakfast, and over oatmeal and iced tea, she explained that
    her goal is to help everyone increase their opportunities for lucky events and
    connections to occur. She starts by dividing people into random groups of five—the
    core luck circle. Each person tells the group one thing that he or she needs to
    get lucky—something that would make a real difference in life. Then the groups
    mingle, and people walk around talking to one another and seeing if they can spread
    luck.

- en: “As you move around, you’re carrying five people’s dreams in your pocket,” Lara
    told us as she sipped her tea. “It’s random, controlled chaos. In the din, we’ll

- en: Lara’s luck circles were inspired by emergence theory—the idea that small things
    can interact and connect to create bigger payoffs. She transferred the academic
    theory to real life in her conferences, with the small circle leading to the bigger
    circle. After you state the one thing you need to get lucky in life, huge repercussions
    occur when others know about it and are inspired to help. As people move around,
    their paths cross, strangers become acquaintances, and somebody you never imagined
    has exactly what you need to get lucky.

  zh: 拉拉的幸运圈灵感来源于涌现理论——即小事物可以相互作用并连接起来，从而产生更大的回报。她把这一学术理论应用到她的会议中，从小圈子扩展到大圈子。在你说出自己生活中需要幸运的那一刻，当别人得知并受到启发去帮助时，巨大的连锁反应便开始发生。当人们四处走动时，他们的路径交错，陌生人变成熟人，而你从未想过的人恰好拥有你所需要的东西，帮你实现幸运。
- en: Lara described one luck circle she ran where a young woman told her group of
    five that she wanted to get a job at a particular national foundation. Nobody
    in the group had an immediate way to help her. But as the small group expanded
    to the larger one, the foundation name got bandied about—and it didn’t take very
    long for someone to remember a colleague who had once worked there and could make
    the right introduction. Wow! The young woman couldn’t believe her luck. She just
    said the right words, and the luck popped up!

- en: “Luck sounds mystical, but it starts from the very grounded place of knowing
    what you want,” Lara told us. “Being declarative about your own desires and putting

- en: To explain how information (and luck) spreads, Dr. Barabási gives the example
    of a cocktail party with a hundred people who don’t know one another. The host
    mentions to one of the guests (we’ll call him John) that the red wine in the unmarked
    decanter is actually a rare and valuable vintage. The host figures that his wine

    with during the course of the party?

  zh: 为了解释信息（以及运气）是如何传播的，巴拉巴西博士举了一个例子，假设在一个有一百人互不相识的鸡尾酒会上。主人告诉其中一位宾客（我们叫他约翰），那瓶无标签的酒壶里装的是一款稀有且珍贵的葡萄酒。主人认为他的酒是相当安全的——毕竟，在派对上，约翰能结识多少人并与他们分享这个信息呢？
- en: 'The answer is: a lot more than you think. The cocktail party turns out to be
    like Lara’s luck circles. What start out as small interactions can spiral into
    big payoffs. So at the start of the party, the guests will naturally break off
    into groups of two or three people to chat. The tidbit about the expensive wine
    is a good icebreaker, so John will surely share the news with his new acquaintances.
    Eventually everyone in the group will drift off to refresh a drink or grab an
    hors d’oeuvre or meet more people. If you figure that each of the three people
    in John’s original group joins another group of three, the story of the vintage
    wine can now spread to nine more people. And eventually those nine will wander
    to other groups with their news.'

  zh: 答案是：远远超过你想象的。这个鸡尾酒会证明，实际上就像拉拉的幸运圈。最初的小互动可能会演变成巨大的回报。所以，在派对开始时，宾客们自然会分成两三人一组聊天。关于昂贵葡萄酒的小道消息是一个很好的破冰话题，因此约翰肯定会与新认识的人分享这个消息。最终，每个人都会去刷新饮料，或者拿点小吃，或者认识更多人。如果你认为约翰原来组中的三个人加入了另外三人的小组，那么关于珍藏酒的消息就能传播到另外九个人。而这些九个人最终会将这个消息带到其他小组中。
- en: According to Dr. Barabási, the mathematicians Paul Erdős and Alfréd Rényi studied
    the problem and concluded that it would take just thirty minutes “to form a single
    invisible social web that includes all the guests in the room.” Just by going
    to that party and moving around, you can get lucky enough to taste the vintage
    wine.

- en: But it also turns out that some parties will be luckier than others—as will
    some cities and towns and universities. Cornell sociology professor Victor Nee
    has been doing research to find out how people create luck for one another in
    a big-city environment, and why big cities tend to have so many creative and academic
    clusters. Doing research on knowledge-based economies, Nee noticed that after
    the financial meltdown of 2008, New York City rebounded with its usual strongholds
    in finance and advertising and arts, but it also developed what he called an “innovation
    cluster” that made it the second-largest technology economy in the country (behind
    only Silicon Valley and its epicenter at Stanford). He was curious to figure out
    what was behind both the resilience and the surge in innovation.

    one sunny morning I joined them for a stroll through Central Park. Nee had his
    English cocker spaniel at his side. The park was both beautifully peaceful and
    very busy—with joggers and bicyclists circling the reservoir and people holding
    casual meetings as they drank coffee outside the Loeb Boathouse. Nee’s well-behaved
    spaniel (named Dustin) got attention from a variety of poodles and mutts and French

    while dog-walking. He spent two years gathering millions of points of data on,

    He collected information on the 50,000 members of New York Tech Meetup, an organization

- en: He realized that people in the tech world attend meetings and parties big and
    small so they can be part of the swirl of ideas constantly percolating when creative
    people get together. “Those face-to-face meetings are important because most innovation
    is about taking existing ideas and recombining them,” Nee said. “All the encounters
    increase the chance that someone will come up with a new combination.” To people
    looking in from the outside, it feels like extraordinary luck when something original
    and exciting pops up. But those in the midst of the maelstrom of millions of meetings
    and exchanges know that it’s a game of odds. The more interactions you have, the
    better your chances of hitting on the one combination of people and ideas that
    creates the explosive *pow* of innovation.

- en: The frequent encounters also create what Nee calls “knowledge spillover.” One
    person has an idea or insight that he can’t use directly in his own work, so he
    shares it with someone else over a beer or at a meetup event. That person finds
    it to be just the link she needs in the company she’s trying to start. “We expect
    people to be competitive and guard their ideas, but instead there’s a great willingness
    to share without any expectation of getting help back,” said Nee. “Making an investment
    in your reputation by sharing knowledge is very rational because others in the
    group see it and know you’re a reliable person, so there may be indirect reciprocity.”
    In other words, helping someone else gets everyone on your side—and makes them
    want to contribute to your lucky outcomes.

- en: If you’re outside the rarefied air of Stanford or the New York high-tech community
    (as most of us are), you can still use the principle of finding luck in other
    people. You may go to a moms’ group, a book club, a yoga studio, or a Lions Club
    meeting to make some of those serendipitous connections. You can always read a
    book curled on the couch or do a side plank pose in your own bedroom, but you
    open yourself to lucky opportunities when you share the experience and have other
    people around you. Many of us like some time to sit alone and work or think or

    What appears to the outside world as random luck often comes from networking behind
    the scenes. He pointed out that the movie *My Big Fat Greek Wedding* is regularly
    used as an example of a hit that came from nowhere. It’s true that it was made
    on a shoestring (which now means $2 million), but writer and star Nia Vardalos
    also found a way to get the movie to Rita Wilson, who she knew was proudly Greek.
    Wilson agreed to help and brought it to her husband, Tom Hanks, who had his production
    company invest in the movie and work on its distribution. Luck, maybe—but the
    kind of luck that comes from connecting to other people.

  zh: 我一直以为有能力和才华就足够了——但Barnaby让我相信，连接和人际网络往往决定了结果。他指出，电影*我的大胖希腊婚礼*经常被用作一个例子，说明一个看似毫无来源的热门作品。的确，它是用一笔微薄的预算拍摄的（现在是200万美元），但编剧兼主演Nia
    Vardalos也找到了一种方式将这部电影递给Rita Wilson，而她知道Wilson是一个骄傲的希腊人。Wilson同意提供帮助，并将电影带给了她的丈夫Tom
    Hanks，他的制作公司投资了这部电影并帮助其分销。也许是运气——但那种来自于与他人连接的运气。

    luck network may be through social media. It doesn’t take much effort to add a
    new friend on Facebook or up your number of Twitter posts. But this is only step
    one, and many studies suggest that online connections don’t really replace face-to-face
    encounters. When social media guru Sree Sreenivasan used Facebook in his job search,
    it was just a way to invite people to meet with him in person via his daily walks.
    The vast majority of people looking for jobs use online sources, and there’s no
    reason not to. But studies suggest that anywhere from 40 to 80 percent of people
    land jobs through direct contact with friends, colleagues, and connections. Having
    coffee with a former colleague may lead to more luck in the work world than another
    hour on LinkedIn.

  zh: 那么，你到底该如何开始建立联系呢？扩展你的“好运网络”最简单的方式可能是通过社交媒体。在Facebook上加一个新朋友，或者增加你的Twitter帖子数量，都不需要太多努力。但这只是第一步，许多研究表明，在线联系并不能真正取代面对面的交流。当社交媒体大师Sree
    Sreenivasan在寻找工作时使用Facebook时，这仅仅是邀请人们通过他每天的散步与他面对面见面的方式。绝大多数求职者使用在线资源，这没有什么不对的。但研究表明，40%到80%的人是通过与朋友、同事和人脉的直接联系找到工作的。与前同事喝咖啡，可能比在LinkedIn上多花一个小时更能带来职场上的好运。
- en: 'The same pattern is true if you’re looking to get lucky in love. Forty million
    or so Americans now use online dating sites, so these are a good way of expanding
    your potentially lucky links. But according to a 2016 Pew survey, even among people
    who have been with their partner for five years or less, fully 88 percent met
    through real-world connections. That may be changing—a recent survey from Match.com
    found that 39 percent of people now meet online. You can take these various survey
    numbers with a grain of salt (if not a whole shaker full), but you also have to
    remember that meeting is just the first step, and nobody gets married online.
    After you’ve swiped right on Tinder, you still have to do the face-to-face part:
    connect for a drink, get to know each other, decide if this is the person who
    will make you lucky in the future. You can’t miss the overall conclusion that
    luck comes from connecting directly with other people.'

    me and has made at least three fortunes on companies that he built and sold. Even
    if I don’t see him for months at a time, I always think of him as one of my closest

    of their speed dial, too. However busy he is at work, Henry always has time for
    the personal—connecting people, helping friends, making other people lucky.[*](43_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_3)

    Now that he’s older, he likes to entertain on one of the islands he owns in the
    British Virgin Islands, wearing a long caftan. He has a brilliant mind and a genius
    IQ, and as was true of Steve Jobs in his black turtlenecks or Mark Zuckerberg
    in his hoodies, Jarecki’s style announces that he’s going to head in his own directions
    in both his business life and his personal one. If you like that message, you

- en: And since you can’t have too much of a good metaphor, Barnaby pointed out that
    commercial fishermen rely on a variety of techniques depending on what they’re
    trying to catch. The big factory ships toss out huge nets to catch everything
    in the area. They have to decide how big the holes in the netting will be—because
    with very small fish you also pull in a lot of sea junk and garbage. When they’re
    after specific kinds of higher-quality fish, they’ll take the time to use separate
    hooks and bait each one with care. And for the biggest and most valuable fish—like
    the bluefin tuna, where a single fish can sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars—fishing
    companies use helicopters to scout from the air and find the fish to target.

  zh: 既然好比喻永远都不嫌多，Barnaby 指出商业渔民会根据他们要捕捉的鱼类种类采用不同的技术。大型渔船会抛出巨大的渔网，捕捉区域内的所有鱼类。他们需要决定网眼的大小——因为如果网眼太小，除了小鱼，还会捞到很多海洋垃圾和废弃物。当他们专门捕捉特定种类的高质量鱼类时，他们会花时间使用单独的钩子，并小心地为每一条鱼装饵。而对于最大、最有价值的鱼类——例如蓝鳍金枪鱼，一条鱼就能卖到数十万美元——渔业公司会使用直升机从空中侦察，找出目标鱼群。
- en: The bigger point here is pretty clear. You have to know what you want before
    you start fishing for luck—and one technique doesn’t work for everyone or every
    goal. Throw a big net, and there’s a good chance you’ll haul in something you
    want, but you have to be willing to put up with a lot of junk, too. Cast just
    a couple of lines, and the odds are lower but more focused.

  zh: 这里更大的观点其实很明确。在开始寻找好运之前，你必须知道自己想要什么——而且一种方法并不适用于每个人或每个目标。撒网越大，你有很大机会捕到你想要的东西，但你也必须准备好忍受很多无用的东西。只抛几条线，机会较低，但更加集中。
- en: I thought of my friend Marnie, who is gregarious and outgoing and so full of
    energy that she could talk to a rock and make it her friend. Lucky things seem
    to happen to her all the time—but (as we’re now discovering) it’s not random.
    Since she talks to everyone, she’s like the fisherman who casts five lines and
    always pulls something in. When she was going to Austin, Texas, recently to visit
    her older son, I asked where she would be staying, and she laughed and rolled
    her eyes. “One of those crazy lucky things that happen to me,” she began. On her
    last trip to Austin, she had gone to a funky local coffee shop and (of course)
    started chatting to the woman next to her in line. By the time their artisanally
    brewed coffees arrived, they were laughing and having so much fun that they sat
    down together to keep talking. When they finally left, the woman explained that
    she traveled a lot, so Marnie was welcome to stay in her condo in Austin anytime
    she visited her son.

    Marnie’s good luck occurred for the same reason that Sree’s did—both of them discovered
    the advantages of having many lines out to catch unexpected luck. (It’s also noteworthy
    that it wasn’t a close friend who offered the condo but a . . . weaker tie.)

- en: The big-net approach doesn’t work for everyone or every goal, and that’s okay,
    too. Being thoughtful and focused in your interactions (a couple of carefully
    baited lines) can sometimes lead to even more luck than a brasher and more scattershot
    approach. If that tends to be your style, you can still be lucky. Back in 2003,
    writer Jonathan Rauch wrote an article for *The Atlantic* called “Caring for Your
    Introvert”, which was one of the magazine’s most popular pieces online for many
    years. He clearly hit a chord among people tired of being told that they needed
    to talk and socialize more to be successful. Rauch pointed out that introverts
    aren’t necessarily shy—they’re just calmer, more reflective, and usually more
    independent minded. Extroverts are energized by other people, while introverts
    tend to wilt after being social for too long and need to be alone to recharge.

- en: Author Susan Cain expanded on that idea in her 2012 bestseller, *Quiet*, pointing
    out that our current culture of personality has made it seem that everybody needs
    to be an extrovert to function well. But introverts form loyal alliances through
    one-on-one interactions, and they’re the ones getting luckier and luckier these
    days. In a follow-up interview a few years after his famous article, Rauch noted
    that geeks—the classic introverts—have been romanticized by Silicon Valley, so
    “the digital economy is giving introverts a new place in the sun.”

- en: But none of this is an excuse to hide away and turn on the TV. Introverts can
    be as sociable as anyone else. If you want to make luck, you have to connect to
    people—in one style or another—and that means making yourself go to the party
    or start the conversation. Sometimes you have to make yourself do something that’s
    not completely natural to make luck. Your own temperament may determine whether

    moved to Los Angeles and got a job in the mailroom of an ad agency. “But I didn’t
    like that, either,” he said. “I wanted to be one of the guys sitting in an office
    getting my mail delivered to me.”

  zh: 大卫在威斯康星州长大，靠卖铝制外墙板支付学费，很快就意识到这不是他一辈子想做的工作。他搬到洛杉矶，进入一家广告公司的邮件室工作。“但我也不喜欢那个，”他说，“我想成为那个坐在办公室里，邮件送到自己面前的人。”

- en: The various connections led to a publicist doing a favor and giving David a
    job at his agency—which was where David met Sammy Davis Jr. They immediately bonded.
    David was half Sammy’s age, but they both liked to go to every party. At the time,
    Sammy was part of a celebrated circle of celebrities—and there was no bigger star.

  zh: 各种各样的关系促成了一位公关人员的帮忙，并为大卫在他的公司找到了一个职位——在那里，大卫遇到了萨米·戴维斯（Sammy Davis Jr.）。他们立刻建立了深厚的友谊。大卫是萨米的一半年龄，但他们都喜欢参加每一个派对。当时，萨米是一个著名名人圈子的一员——而且没有比他更大的明星了。
- en: “He wanted to have as much fun as I did,” David said. “I had a credit card with
    a $250 limit, but I was traveling around the world with him and going to dinner
    parties with Frank Sinatra and Lucille Ball. I met everybody.” Those connections
    led to possibilities—and eventually he started his own PR company out of the back
    of Sammy’s office. “I just kept running. Whenever there was an opportunity, I
    put myself in that place,” he told me.

  zh: “他想和我一样尽情享乐，”大卫说。“我有一张250美元额度的信用卡，但我和他一起环游世界，参加法兰克·辛纳特拉和露西尔·鲍尔的晚宴。我遇到了所有人。”这些关系带来了可能性——最终，他在萨米的办公室后面创办了自己的公关公司。“我就一直在跑。每当有机会，我就把自己放在那个位置，”他告诉我。
- en: David instinctively realized that if you want other people to make you lucky,
    you need to make them feel lucky, too. Life doesn’t track one way. Early in his
    career when he was (as he joked) “apparently successful but realistically broke,”
    David was going to dinner at the Hotel Bel-Air one night with six Hollywood friends.
    He saw it as his chance to be generous, so he gave his credit card to the maître
    d’ ahead of time—not realizing that one of the guests, the actor Peter Sellers,
    had preordered for the whole table.

  zh: 大卫凭直觉意识到，如果你希望别人让你变得幸运，你也需要让他们感到幸运。生活不是单行道。大卫在职业生涯初期（正如他开玩笑说的那样）“表面上很成功，但实际上破产了”，有一天他和六个好莱坞朋友一起去贝尔艾尔酒店吃晚餐。他把这当作自己慷慨的机会，于是提前将信用卡交给了领班——却没有意识到其中一位客人，演员彼得·塞勒斯，已经为全桌预定了菜肴。
- en: “All of a sudden there were mounds of caviar coming out and rack of lamb, and
    I thought, ‘I am now one credit card statement away from disaster,’” he said.
    But he let the card go through, amazed that it wasn’t denied. He knew it was important
    to give as well as take.

  zh: “突然间，鱼子酱堆积如山，羊排一整架地端出来，我心想，‘我现在只差一张信用卡账单就能陷入灾难了，’”他说。但他还是让信用卡过了，惊讶于它没有被拒绝。他知道，给予和接受同样重要。
- en: Later, when he became a manager, he produced various shows for Robin Williams
    and Billy Crystal, took notes on their live performances, and helped them develop
    some of their material. “My job was just to make them look good,” he said. A manager’s
    motivations can be tinged by self-interest—“we’re human, not robots”—but since
    he was known for integrity and putting his clients first, his career kept getting
    bigger. By making others lucky, he increased his own luck, too.

  zh: 后来，当他成为经理人时，他为罗宾·威廉姆斯和比利·克里斯托尔制作了多个节目，记录他们的现场表演，并帮助他们发展部分创意。“我的工作就是让他们看起来更好，”他说。一个经理人的动机可能带有一些自私成分——“我们是人类，不是机器人”——但由于他以诚信和将客户放在第一位而闻名，他的事业也因此越来越大。通过让他人变得幸运，他也增加了自己的好运。
- en: “I flunked out of college twice, and I was a discipline problem growing up,
    but I had good instincts and understood comedy,” he said. “I never took myself
    too seriously or told anyone why I’m so important. But I was interested in other
    people and liked to get new experiences—and that all made me lucky.”

  zh: “我上大学挂了两次科，小时候也曾是个纪律问题，但我有很好的直觉，并且理解喜剧，”他说。“我从不把自己看得太重要，也不告诉别人我为什么那么重要。但我对别人感兴趣，喜欢尝试新体验——这些都让我变得幸运。”
- en: Other people can make you lucky when you give to them without worrying about
    what will come back. You pay for dinner at the Bel-Air, you help a big star become
    even bigger, you offer to work for free just to be around interesting people (he
    did that early in his career, too). David had met me on a plane, but he spent
    three hours at lunch sharing great stories and insights without expecting a return.
    And when the check came and I reached for it, he grabbed it and rolled his eyes.
    “Really?” he asked.

  zh: 当你无所顾虑地付出，而不担心回报时，别人也能让你变得幸运。你在贝尔艾尔餐厅付账，你帮助一位大明星变得更大，你主动为有趣的人免费工作（他早期职业生涯也这么做过）。大卫是在飞机上遇到我的，但他在午餐时花了三个小时和我分享精彩的故事和见解，毫无回报期待。当账单递过来，我伸手去拿时，他抢过账单并翻了个白眼。“真的吗？”他问。
- en: Making someone else feel lucky without knowing how (or if) you’ll get it back
    can be a risk. But it’s a risk worth taking. Not every person you meet is going
    to help you make luck, but you need only a couple. (And you can still have fun
    and interesting times with the rest.) David was the Hollywood example of what
    Professor Nee had described as investing in your reputation by sharing knowledge.
    As so often happens to people who do that, what came back for him was buckets
    of luck.

  zh: 让别人感到幸运，而不知自己是否能从中得到回报，这可能是一种风险。但这是一项值得冒的风险。并不是你遇到的每个人都会帮你创造运气，但你只需要遇到几个这样的人。（你依然可以和其他人一起度过有趣的时光。）大卫是好莱坞的典型例子，体现了Nee教授所描述的通过分享知识来投资自己声誉的理念。正如许多这样做的人常常会遇到的那样，回报给他的是一桶桶的好运。

    his books that “once upon a time people were born into communities and had to
    find their individuality. Today people are born individuals and have to find their
    communities.” Being part of a community opens you to a network of possibilities.
    Being part of *many* communities expands your weak ties and invisible webs and
    dramatically increases the chance of lucky events coming your way.

- en: I left the lunch thinking of all the different ways that luck comes from other
    people. And I also realized that to make that luck happen, you need to take action
    within your social circles, however you define them, and do so in a way that feels
    genuine to you. You might pick up the phone and call an acquaintance you haven’t
    spoken to in a year. At a coffee shop or a local park or on an airplane, look
    up and take in the people around you. Maybe there is someone sipping their latte
    or walking their dog who can help you plant the seeds for luck. If you think about
    what you need to get lucky and let as many people as possible know about it, you
    can essentially form your own luck circle—and watch it pay off.

  zh: 我离开午餐时，脑海里想着运气来自他人的各种不同方式。我还意识到，要让这种运气发生，你需要在你的社交圈中采取行动，不管你如何定义这些圈子，并且以对自己来说真诚的方式去做。你可能会拿起电话，拨给一个已经一年没联系的熟人。在咖啡馆、公园或飞机上，抬头看看周围的人。也许有一个人正在喝着拿铁或遛着狗，他能帮助你种下幸运的种子。如果你想清楚你需要什么来获得好运，并让尽可能多的人知道这一点，你就能建立起属于自己的幸运圈——然后看着它带来回报。
