    we all drifted over to the table, which had been set up for dessert. As we tucked
    into fruit and gelato (and chocolate cookies, let’s admit), one of the women said
    she had an announcement. Her husband had a friend who used to work with a talented
    guy in the digital world who just got fired and needed a new job. Did anybody
    have any leads?

    surprised to find out that Barnaby knew him, since Sree clearly had a huge network.
    How else would an Indian journalist who was born in Tokyo end up being discussed
    by a bunch of women in an Upper East Side book group? When I checked out his story,
    Sree turned out to be the perfect example of Barnaby’s next principle—that you
    make luck through other people.

    the first chief digital officer of the Metropolitan Museum of Art—a position created
    just for him. He considered it a dream job. But after three years, the Met decided
    to cut back top staff, and in June 2016, he was let go. He said later that his
    first reaction was panic, and he thought about retreating. Climbing into a hole
    is a natural reaction when you’re down, but unless you’re a badger, holes don’t
    lead anywhere. So he decided to use his many friends and followers on social media
    for support. He announced his situation on Facebook and said that he usually walked
    for five miles every day—and now that he had more time, it would be ten miles.
    He invited people to sign up to walk and talk with him, and he put up a form that
    read: “If there’s one thing Sree should consider doing next it is . . .” Some
    1,300 people reached out to him in what he called a “global digital hug.” He was
    apparently being discussed everywhere—including at my book club. By the end of
    the month, he had a new job as chief digital officer for the City of New York—a
    much bigger job than where he had been.'

    all clear about the help we need, the more that people can help us.”

    Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig has argued that the more interconnected
    we are, the more creative and innovative we become.[*](41_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1)
    Expanding on this idea, writer Steven Johnson points out in his book *Where Good
    Ideas Come From* that during the Renaissance, breakthroughs arose from “the inventive
    genius, the rogue visionary who somehow sees beyond the horizon that limits his
    contemporaries—da Vinci, Copernicus, Galileo.” But after 1800, there was a huge
    change, and now most innovation occurs in collaborative environments. Rather than
    sitting alone at a desk and hoping for a eureka moment, most creative people are
    sharing ideas and building on one another’s work. Executives and investors are
    talking to one another about possibilities. In our more networked world, working
    with other people creates luck.

    propel you into the luck stratosphere are sometimes the most unexpected.

    and Harvard and is now a chaired professor of sociology at Stanford, refers to
    this as “the strength of weak ties.”[*](42_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_2) You have
    strong ties with people like close friends or colleagues whom you see at least
    once a week and weak ties with those you encounter less frequently. Interestingly,
    it’s the weak ties that usually matter, whether you’re looking to land a potential
    mate or a new job in digital media. You and your best friends already know most
    of the same people—you have “overlapping social circles,” as the sociologists
    like to say. But those with whom you’re more weakly tied—like Sree and the ladies
    at the book club—probably have an entirely different social network. Connecting
    with them opens up a whole new community of possibilities—and because each new
    person is connected to many others, your possibilities are suddenly vastly larger.

    of networks at conferences she runs. A consultant to many nonprofit organizations,
    she organizes luck circles instead of the standard bonding exercises that many
    of us have come to dread (beach Olympics, anyone?). Barnaby and I met Lara at
    a local café for breakfast, and over oatmeal and iced tea, she explained that
    her goal is to help everyone increase their opportunities for lucky events and
    connections to occur. She starts by dividing people into random groups of five—the
    core luck circle. Each person tells the group one thing that he or she needs to
    get lucky—something that would make a real difference in life. Then the groups
    mingle, and people walk around talking to one another and seeing if they can spread
    luck.

    told us as she sipped her tea. “It’s random, controlled chaos. In the din, we’ll

    luck.”

    can interact and connect to create bigger payoffs. She transferred the academic
    theory to real life in her conferences, with the small circle leading to the bigger
    circle. After you state the one thing you need to get lucky in life, huge repercussions
    occur when others know about it and are inspired to help. As people move around,
    their paths cross, strangers become acquaintances, and somebody you never imagined
    has exactly what you need to get lucky.

    five that she wanted to get a job at a particular national foundation. Nobody
    in the group had an immediate way to help her. But as the small group expanded
    to the larger one, the foundation name got bandied about—and it didn’t take very
    long for someone to remember a colleague who had once worked there and could make
    the right introduction. Wow! The young woman couldn’t believe her luck. She just
    said the right words, and the luck popped up!

    what you want,” Lara told us. “Being declarative about your own desires and putting
    them into the world creates the conditions for luck. When you have clear ideas
    of what you want and see the world as something you can affect, you elicit lucky
    reactions. It’s about openness and possibility and capturing chance.”

    done by a professor named Albert-László Barabási. He has so many professional
    titles that it seems like he could get lucky networking with himself—he’s a professor
    of physics as well as of computer and information science at Northeastern University,
    runs that school’s Center for Complex Network Research, and has appointments at
    Harvard Medical School and two major teaching hospitals. Born in Transylvania,
    Romania, he lectures so often around the world that it’s a surprise he never ran

    of a cocktail party with a hundred people who don’t know one another. The host
    mentions to one of the guests (we’ll call him John) that the red wine in the unmarked
    decanter is actually a rare and valuable vintage. The host figures that his wine
    is pretty safe—after all, how many people can John meet and share the information
    with during the course of the party?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The answer is: a lot more than you think. The cocktail party turns out to be
    like Lara’s luck circles. What start out as small interactions can spiral into
    big payoffs. So at the start of the party, the guests will naturally break off
    into groups of two or three people to chat. The tidbit about the expensive wine
    is a good icebreaker, so John will surely share the news with his new acquaintances.
    Eventually everyone in the group will drift off to refresh a drink or grab an
    hors d’oeuvre or meet more people. If you figure that each of the three people
    in John’s original group joins another group of three, the story of the vintage
    wine can now spread to nine more people. And eventually those nine will wander
    to other groups with their news.'

    the problem and concluded that it would take just thirty minutes “to form a single

    to that party and moving around, you can get lucky enough to taste the vintage
    wine.

    some cities and towns and universities. Cornell sociology professor Victor Nee
    has been doing research to find out how people create luck for one another in
    a big-city environment, and why big cities tend to have so many creative and academic
    clusters. Doing research on knowledge-based economies, Nee noticed that after
    the financial meltdown of 2008, New York City rebounded with its usual strongholds
    in finance and advertising and arts, but it also developed what he called an “innovation
    cluster” that made it the second-largest technology economy in the country (behind
    only Silicon Valley and its epicenter at Stanford). He was curious to figure out
    what was behind both the resilience and the surge in innovation.

    one sunny morning I joined them for a stroll through Central Park. Nee had his
    English cocker spaniel at his side. The park was both beautifully peaceful and
    very busy—with joggers and bicyclists circling the reservoir and people holding
    casual meetings as they drank coffee outside the Loeb Boathouse. Nee’s well-behaved
    spaniel (named Dustin) got attention from a variety of poodles and mutts and French
    bulldogs, and it was easy to see how New York could feel like a very small community
    as the various dog owners started chatting together.

    to have face-to-face interactions. Look how simple it was for us to get together
    today. You just walk out of your apartment and you can encounter someone useful.
    The secret juice of New York City is that it’s very easy for people to meet.”

    Center for the Study of Economy & Society, Nee goes well beyond making observations
    while dog-walking. He spent two years gathering millions of points of data on,
    as he put it, “every instant when people got together to talk about technology.”
    He collected information on the 50,000 members of New York Tech Meetup, an organization
    that holds monthly meetings with speakers as well as social events and parties.
    He added in information on smaller specialized sessions that members organize
    and meetup groups in specific fields and much more.

    small so they can be part of the swirl of ideas constantly percolating when creative
    people get together. “Those face-to-face meetings are important because most innovation
    is about taking existing ideas and recombining them,” Nee said. “All the encounters
    increase the chance that someone will come up with a new combination.” To people
    looking in from the outside, it feels like extraordinary luck when something original
    and exciting pops up. But those in the midst of the maelstrom of millions of meetings
    and exchanges know that it’s a game of odds. The more interactions you have, the
    better your chances of hitting on the one combination of people and ideas that
    creates the explosive *pow* of innovation.
  prefs: []

- en: The frequent encounters also create what Nee calls “knowledge spillover.” One
    person has an idea or insight that he can’t use directly in his own work, so he
    shares it with someone else over a beer or at a meetup event. That person finds
    it to be just the link she needs in the company she’s trying to start. “We expect
    people to be competitive and guard their ideas, but instead there’s a great willingness
    to share without any expectation of getting help back,” said Nee. “Making an investment
    in your reputation by sharing knowledge is very rational because others in the
    group see it and know you’re a reliable person, so there may be indirect reciprocity.”
    In other words, helping someone else gets everyone on your side—and makes them
    want to contribute to your lucky outcomes.

    people. You may go to a moms’ group, a book club, a yoga studio, or a Lions Club
    meeting to make some of those serendipitous connections. You can always read a
    book curled on the couch or do a side plank pose in your own bedroom, but you
    open yourself to lucky opportunities when you share the experience and have other
    people around you. Many of us like some time to sit alone and work or think or
    relax, and that can definitely be part of good days. But lucky sparks happen when
    people rub against each other.

    convinced me that connections and personal networks often make the difference.
    What appears to the outside world as random luck often comes from networking behind
    the scenes. He pointed out that the movie *My Big Fat Greek Wedding* is regularly
    used as an example of a hit that came from nowhere. It’s true that it was made
    on a shoestring (which now means $2 million), but writer and star Nia Vardalos
    also found a way to get the movie to Rita Wilson, who she knew was proudly Greek.
    Wilson agreed to help and brought it to her husband, Tom Hanks, who had his production
    company invest in the movie and work on its distribution. Luck, maybe—but the
    kind of luck that comes from connecting to other people.

    luck network may be through social media. It doesn’t take much effort to add a
    new friend on Facebook or up your number of Twitter posts. But this is only step
    one, and many studies suggest that online connections don’t really replace face-to-face
    encounters. When social media guru Sree Sreenivasan used Facebook in his job search,
    it was just a way to invite people to meet with him in person via his daily walks.
    The vast majority of people looking for jobs use online sources, and there’s no
    reason not to. But studies suggest that anywhere from 40 to 80 percent of people
    land jobs through direct contact with friends, colleagues, and connections. Having
    coffee with a former colleague may lead to more luck in the work world than another
    hour on LinkedIn.

    or so Americans now use online dating sites, so these are a good way of expanding
    your potentially lucky links. But according to a 2016 Pew survey, even among people
    who have been with their partner for five years or less, fully 88 percent met
    through real-world connections. That may be changing—a recent survey from Match.com
    found that 39 percent of people now meet online. You can take these various survey
    numbers with a grain of salt (if not a whole shaker full), but you also have to
    remember that meeting is just the first step, and nobody gets married online.
    After you’ve swiped right on Tinder, you still have to do the face-to-face part:
    connect for a drink, get to know each other, decide if this is the person who
    will make you lucky in the future. You can’t miss the overall conclusion that
    luck comes from connecting directly with other people.'

    with very small fish you also pull in a lot of sea junk and garbage. When they’re
    after specific kinds of higher-quality fish, they’ll take the time to use separate
    hooks and bait each one with care. And for the biggest and most valuable fish—like
    the bluefin tuna, where a single fish can sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars—fishing
    companies use helicopters to scout from the air and find the fish to target.

    want, but you have to be willing to put up with a lot of junk, too. Cast just
    a couple of lines, and the odds are lower but more focused.

    her older son, I asked where she would be staying, and she laughed and rolled
    her eyes. “One of those crazy lucky things that happen to me,” she began. On her
    last trip to Austin, she had gone to a funky local coffee shop and (of course)

    too. Being thoughtful and focused in your interactions (a couple of carefully
    baited lines) can sometimes lead to even more luck than a brasher and more scattershot
    approach. If that tends to be your style, you can still be lucky. Back in 2003,
    writer Jonathan Rauch wrote an article for *The Atlantic* called “Caring for Your
    Introvert”, which was one of the magazine’s most popular pieces online for many
    years. He clearly hit a chord among people tired of being told that they needed
    to talk and socialize more to be successful. Rauch pointed out that introverts
    aren’t necessarily shy—they’re just calmer, more reflective, and usually more
    independent minded. Extroverts are energized by other people, while introverts
    tend to wilt after being social for too long and need to be alone to recharge.

    days. In a follow-up interview a few years after his famous article, Rauch noted

    or start the conversation. Sometimes you have to make yourself do something that’s
    not completely natural to make luck. Your own temperament may determine whether
    you talk to everyone at the party or sit quietly with just a couple of others.

    headphones, and as we taxied down the runway, I glanced over at the man sitting
    next to me. He had a stack of magazines like *Variety* and *Hollywood Reporter*—which
    suggested we might be in similar fields. That was interesting. Maybe I should
    cast a (well-curated) line and try to make luck.

    His name was David Steinberg, and it turned out he was (among other things) the
    personal manager for huge stars including Bette Midler and Billy Crystal and the
    much-missed Robin Williams. When I told him that I was now investigating luck,
    he gave a big smile.

    needed to see possibilities and grab opportunities (or sometimes craft their own).
    He had so many stories that the ninety-minute flight wasn’t nearly enough. When
    we landed, we agreed to have lunch together sometime in New York.

    not every time and certainly not every day, but just being aware of the principles
    (*luck is other people*) changed your focus and let you pay attention to the right
    things. In this case, I’d cast a line and met someone interesting. He wasn’t lending
    me a condo in Austin, but not every connection needs an immediate payoff.

    had something even better (for me) than a condo—great stories about people making
    luck for other people. He said that when he started out in his own career, he
    didn’t realize how he was making his own luck. But reflection (and many years)
    made it all clearer.

    like that, either,” he said. “I wanted to be one of the guys sitting in an office
    getting my mail delivered to me.”

    job at his agency—which was where David met Sammy Davis Jr. They immediately bonded.
    David was half Sammy’s age, but they both liked to go to every party. At the time,
    Sammy was part of a celebrated circle of celebrities—and there was no bigger star.

    a $250 limit, but I was traveling around the world with him and going to dinner
    parties with Frank Sinatra and Lucille Ball. I met everybody.” Those connections
    led to possibilities—and eventually he started his own PR company out of the back
    of Sammy’s office. “I just kept running. Whenever there was an opportunity, I
    put myself in that place,” he told me.

    you need to make them feel lucky, too. Life doesn’t track one way. Early in his
    career when he was (as he joked) “apparently successful but realistically broke,”
    David was going to dinner at the Hotel Bel-Air one night with six Hollywood friends.
    He saw it as his chance to be generous, so he gave his credit card to the maître
    d’ ahead of time—not realizing that one of the guests, the actor Peter Sellers,
    had preordered for the whole table.

    to give as well as take.

    and Billy Crystal, took notes on their live performances, and helped them develop
    some of their material. “My job was just to make them look good,” he said. A manager’s
    motivations can be tinged by self-interest—“we’re human, not robots”—but since
    he was known for integrity and putting his clients first, his career kept getting
    bigger. By making others lucky, he increased his own luck, too.

    people and liked to get new experiences—and that all made me lucky.”

    what will come back. You pay for dinner at the Bel-Air, you help a big star become
    even bigger, you offer to work for free just to be around interesting people (he
    did that early in his career, too). David had met me on a plane, but he spent
    three hours at lunch sharing great stories and insights without expecting a return.
    And when the check came and I reached for it, he grabbed it and rolled his eyes.
    “Really?” he asked.

    can be a risk. But it’s a risk worth taking. Not every person you meet is going
    to help you make luck, but you need only a couple. (And you can still have fun
    and interesting times with the rest.) David was the Hollywood example of what
    Professor Nee had described as investing in your reputation by sharing knowledge.
    As so often happens to people who do that, what came back for him was buckets
    of luck.

    his books that “once upon a time people were born into communities and had to
    find their individuality. Today people are born individuals and have to find their
    communities.” Being part of a community opens you to a network of possibilities.
    Being part of *many* communities expands your weak ties and invisible webs and
    dramatically increases the chance of lucky events coming your way.

    people. And I also realized that to make that luck happen, you need to take action
    within your social circles, however you define them, and do so in a way that feels
    genuine to you. You might pick up the phone and call an acquaintance you haven’t
    spoken to in a year. At a coffee shop or a local park or on an airplane, look
    up and take in the people around you. Maybe there is someone sipping their latte
    or walking their dog who can help you plant the seeds for luck. If you think about
    what you need to get lucky and let as many people as possible know about it, you
    can essentially form your own luck circle—and watch it pay off.

    people to help you get lucky.
