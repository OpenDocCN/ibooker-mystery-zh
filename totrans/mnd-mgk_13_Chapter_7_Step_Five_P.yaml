    Zone, known by sailors as “the doldrums.” Near the thermal equator, the northeast
    and southeast trade winds converge, and as the northeast winds die off, they are
    replaced by long periods of calm followed by severe buffeting squalls and light,
    baffling winds. It is considered a navigator’s nightmare because it is almost
    impossible to tell which way the current is heading, at what speed, and from what
    direction the wind blew in the last squall.

    he put on a brave face for the media and the Polynesians placing their deepest
    hopes on his success, he doubted his ability to navigate under nearly 100 percent
    cloud cover with no access to the celestial clues he had learned for guidance.
    He lacked the confidence to trust his own instincts. He was afraid of sailing
    blind, and that is exactly what happened.

    myself prior to the voyage that I would have no confidence in knowing where to
    go. I turned the canoe on a new course, got things lined up, and felt very, very
    comfortable in this cold, wet, rough environment. And then—just for a moment—there
    was a break in the clouds and the light of the moon shone through, just where
    I expected it to be. I can’t explain it, but that was one of the most precious

    setbacks, and frustrations. We may even be overcome with self-doubt, losing confidence
    in our abilities to realize our intentions and losing sight, as Nainoa Thompson
    did, of the guides and clues we were relying on to lead our journey. When we are
    facing our own dark night, swarmed by fears and old stories that taunt us with
    the illusion that we are incapable, unworthy, or wrong, we can turn our attention
    back to our deepest intention and take refuge in the simple and powerful practices
    we have been cultivating to express the compass of our hearts. And when we are
    groping our way through the pitch-darkness of whatever jungle we are lost in like

    the process of placing one’s intention into the subconscious, which takes many
    rounds of repetition. As with any practice, it is wise to start with a small,
    manageable goal that is not too far out of reach. If we try to jump ahead a million
    steps and expect spectacular results instantly, we will inevitably feel let down
    and become discouraged with the entire process. Even worse, we will probably become
    excessively self-critical and take our disappointment out on ourselves. Achieving
    a small goal helps us to build confidence in ourselves and in the process itself,
    and the positive emotions we feel upon achieving the goal buoy us up to pursue
    the next one. This is the nature of small changes or baby steps. They strengthen
    us without overwhelming us.
  prefs: []

    allow us to leap over the laws of physics or the natural stages of human development.
    There is no ceiling to what we can pursue, but even our wildest dreams can only
    be realized one step at a time. Although it may sometimes work quickly, manifesting
    does not just magically happen overnight. It does not go from zero to one hundred
    in a microsecond. It must also be recognized that manifesting is not a passive
    endeavor. It is an active process of taking baby steps that lead to the ultimate
    goal. One must also be committed to the work involved in manifesting, whether
    that means pursuing an academic achievement or trying to bench-press four hundred
    pounds. That said, we can manifest extraordinary things, but first they must be
    embedded in the subconscious. Over time, as opportunities present themselves and
    we respond, each of these small events ultimately contribute to the manifestation
    of that intention.

    one. It is not only repetition that forms a habit; it is the positive emotion

- en: The nervous system is constantly responding to those around us and our environment,
    scanning for threats and opportunities. Through the process described by Stephen
    Porges as *neuroception*, a subconscious system for detecting threats and safety,
    we classify every encounter with another person as safe or dangerous, subconsciously
    deciding to approach or move away. When we are in the rest-and-digest mode, our
    bodies express what is known as the *social engagement system*, accompanied by
    a series of physiological changes. Our heart rate slows, saliva and digestion
    are activated, facial muscles are stimulated to express positive mental states,
    and there is an increase in vocal expressiveness and a willingness to make sustained
    eye contact with others. These changes affect how we react to stimuli, what kinds
    of expressions appear on our face, and, most importantly for manifesting, how
    others respond to us. When we look at the world in a different way, we move through
    it in a different way, and in turn the world sees us in a different way. One extraordinary
    example is that the middle-range muscles in our ears come online, and these are
    the muscles that are designed to hear nuances in the human voice. As researchers
    into the polyvagal theory have discovered, the human voice sounds special to our
    ears only when we feel safe. When we are in fight, flight, or freeze, our ears
    focus only on high and low frequencies because these tend to indicate the approach
    of predators. In other words, only when we feel safe and taken care of can we
    truly hear another human being.

    listen, not just sit there watching the other person talk while I prepare my own
    calculated response. It has often been said about brain surgeons that we are “often
    wrong, never in doubt.” I used to bring this arrogant attitude to all my interactions,
    and the truth is that I was depriving myself of actual connection with others.
    The more I practiced just being OK with myself, the more I found I was able to
    attune to others and really take in what they were saying. In a sense, manifesting
    is the skill of connecting to those around us, our environment and our context,
    and kindness and genuine compassion are our direct physiological pathways to that
    connection. When we express the prosocial physiology of the rest-and-digest response,
    others instinctively want to help us achieve our goals because they sense our
    actions are serving the greater good and making a contribution to the whole. In
    fact, the pleasure and reward systems of our brains light up not only when we
    are being generous or experiencing the generosity of others but also as a response
    to food, money, and sex.

    us and enjoy being around us. Part of the power of the mammalian caregiving system
    is that when we ourselves are in distress, or we encounter distress in others,
    we can, if we feel safe enough, choose to self-soothe and practice compassion
    instead of fighting or withdrawing. Consequently, because we naturally mirror
    the autonomic state of people around us, our Green Zone state can trigger the
    Green Zone state in others because they then feel safe, relaxed, and at ease in
    our presence. Our self-compassion can be contagious, as with the electromagnetic
    field of the heart in a state of coherence. Feeling safe is necessary to form
    strong social relationships. Safety allows for physical proximity and the intimacy-building
    that arises from friendly and caring touch. Positive physical contact promotes
    the release of oxytocin, which in turn allows for social bonding to take place.
    We need to feel safe enough to be physically close to others in order to become
    emotionally close.

    Rather than visualizing how a good score might benefit only her personal desires,
    she shifted the focus to imagine how she could serve her future patients and all
    the help and healing she could offer them through her care if she became their
    doctor. Carrying this new heartfelt aspiration into her test-taking, Anula was
    able to remain more focused on her answers, recall her knowledge more effectively,
    and ultimately, score higher than before. This is the alchemy that occurs when
    a desire meets an open-heart yearning for connection. When we reflect on our personal
    desires, we discover beneath them a deeper longing to contribute to our world.
    In the manifesting process, this is not just a heartwarming side effect; it is
    a full-on strategic asset. The world responds favorably and generously to a purpose
    that heals and invites life to flow. By tuning into how our intention can serve
    others, we invite benefactors and assistance we could never have imagined if we
    had pursued our goal only for our own self-interest.

    around for whoever was over, entertaining everyone. The other was trying to relieve
    the suffering of his mother. He wanted her to feel a sense of freedom, and a sense
    that “her life was worth something because she gave birth to someone who was worth
    something.” And then he would retreat to his room and sit with a legal pad on
    his lap and ask the big questions, even as a small child: “Why are we here? What
    is this?” Later, he read a quotation from the Buddha that said the purpose of
    all spirituality is to relieve suffering. And he had the sudden realization, “*That’s

    we learned about the filing clerk and the bloodhound in our subconscious. Once
    the filing clerk has classified our intention as salient and given its scent to
    the bloodhound, the hound will begin to hunt for any trace of opportunity to fulfill
    our intention. This is the origin of the phenomenon of *synchronicity*, the sudden,
    often surprising appearance of meaningful coincidences in our lives that we did
    not notice before. If we are stuck in our manifesting process, we can practice
    paying careful attention to the subtle hints and unexpected connections we may
    have dismissed as accidental or irrelevant. Often these strange confluences can
    be subtle signposts that guide us enigmatically on our path. Only when we look
    back and reflect on the string of connections do we realize their internal logic.

    down the street. The translator called Habibullah and said, “Habibullah, salaam
    aleikum. I have a surprise for you.”

    of the military conflict. She went directly to his house and asked about Rohullah.
    Habibullah revealed that Rohullah’s father had just died, and he was finally back
    in Afghanistan after years in Norway obtaining a master’s degree in peace studies.
    Habibullah called Rohullah and said, “I have a surprise for you.”

    was building the Torch of Light School for the children of the Taliban and Amandine
    was working to create the Amanuddin Foundation to promote peace and nonviolence
    and to cultivate yoga and meditation practices for local Afghans. They decided
    to work together.

    “Please help me,” he said. Because he had been working on women’s empowerment
    with the UN, the Taliban wanted Rohullah killed. He had escaped to Istanbul and
    was trying to come to France. Amandine used her connections to get him a visa,
    and today Rohullah is a French citizen. Finally, Amandine was able to offer help
    in return for his great kindness.

- en: Making the most of synchronicity is a habit we can practice. As our subconscious
    begins tuning in to our environment for opportunities to realize our intention,
    it is as if we put on night-vision goggles. Whereas before, we were working blind
    in the middle of the night, unable to see anything around us, but with the goggles
    on, all kinds of new, unnoticed movements become visible, and suddenly opportunities
    are everywhere. We are no longer in the dark. This strange intertwining of interests,
    desires, and events is a phenomenon that often arises when we allow our intention
    to sink into our subconscious and start interacting with the world at large. Try
    this practice to increase your own receptivity to the hints your world is offering
    you.

- en: Sometimes, to realize our intention, we must commit to putting in some hard
    work. The process is the same as when building any positive habit. As an example,
    over the last few years I’ve gained weight, which, in conjunction with an old
    skiing accident where I injured my left knee, further limited my desire and motivation
    to exercise. I live in a hilly neighborhood; when I step out of my house, I am
    faced immediately with a steep incline. I had not exercised for a while, but I
    decided to lose weight. By this time I had remarried; I recruited my new wife
    to help me, and early one morning we went for a walk up the hills. Right away,
    I was huffing and puffing, and saying, “God, this is not going to work. I can’t
    do this. This is horrible, my knee is killing me.”
  prefs: []

- en: My body, which wasn’t used to pumping blood at that level, rebelled at the discomfort,
    and that produced mental signals in the form of “I can’t do this, I can’t take
    this, it’s not going to work.” But actually, all that was happening was resistance
    because I was out of shape. I quickly gave up and went back into the house to
    lick my wounds. Then one day I woke up at five thirty a.m. and said, “Fuck it,
    I’m just going to do it.” I envisioned myself not only doing it but being in good
    physical shape. I did the entire walk without stopping, although I was definitely
    huffing and puffing and my knee was hurting. Now I have been doing it for a few
    weeks. And the funny thing is, every morning I wake up and say, “I hate this.
    I do not want to do this; it isn’t going to work.” And then I just put my clothes
    on and go do it. I override my pain and my fear of discomfort because I know that
    in the long run, the exercise is healthy for me, perhaps lifesaving. I teach my
    body that what it is resistant to doing in the short term will benefit it in the
    long term. What I realize is that each time I complete my walk, I feel inspired
    and elevated because I am reminded, first, that anything is possible with the
    right intention, and second, that my walks up the hill will ultimately benefit
    me and I can enjoy the sense of well-being that they bring.

    life. In those moments, while everyone around me was panicking, I returned to
    my fundamental practices: I calmed my mind, relaxed my body, and opened my heart.
    I visualized exactly the procedure that I needed to do in order to save my patient’s
    life, and I let myself and my hands be guided by a possibility that is beyond
    reason, and beyond skill. I let go of my conscious mind’s frantic desire to control
    the situation and make it reasonable and predictable, and I surrendered to the
    amazing skill of my subconscious, by which life itself could flow through me.'
