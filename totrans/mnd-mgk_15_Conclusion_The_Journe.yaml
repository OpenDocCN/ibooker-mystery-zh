- en: It is the end of the day on a Friday, and I drive up the tree-lined drive to
    my home in Los Altos Hills, California. Even as I approach where I live, I begin
    to be suffused with a feeling of warmth, safety, and peace. Looking over the familiar
    scene and being greeted by my wife and sons, my heart resonates with the images
    I pictured for so long in my mind, and I know I belong here.

- en: 'Where the garden at my former mansion was left to languish and wither, today
    I am surrounded by living growth: cherry, peach, olive, and pear trees, three
    varieties of apple trees, lemon trees, and an orange tree, all generously bearing
    flowers and fruit. Flanking the front of the house are the three parrotia, or
    Persian ironwood, trees that I had imported for their singular shape and color.
    I am also struck by the oak tree in the front yard that traveled from San Diego
    to be part of my home. At the time it was planted, it was ten feet high; it has
    now grown to over twenty-five feet and, like the parrotias, embraces my home with
    its branches. As I walk toward the front door, I am greeted by the soothing sound
    of water flowing over the ancient boulders into the small pond by my house, which
    tells me I can relax: I am safe. As I do almost every day, I pass by the chicken
    coop, the beehives, and the treehouse on stilts that I had built for my sons.
    It is connected to the living trees with a zip line stretched out from the roof
    across the back of the yard.'

- en: I survey the beautiful house we live in, built in a contemporary Asian style
    according to inspiration from my travels and reading, crafted to provide a soothing
    atmosphere of tranquility. This house, too, I designed myself and envisioned over
    and over in great detail before it was constructed. When I first pictured the
    house, I knew there would be a dramatic centerpiece drawing the eye through the
    space all the way from the doorway out past the pool. Today, I see the modern
    cast-bronze statue of a headless Buddha holding a persimmon that I bought at an
    auction for the Dalai Lama Foundation seated and presiding over the backyard in
    serenity.

- en: 'The truth is, staying on course is a daily struggle. I knew I would need a
    lot of help to continue listening to my own inner compass and not go off track
    again, and so my home is full of guideposts for myself. The headless bronze Buddha
    reminds me not to get lost in my head and to always go back to my heart. And the
    persimmon the Buddha holds has a powerful symbolic meaning, too: persimmons start
    out as bitter and hard, but if you are patient, they ripen to become soft and
    intensely sweet. This image inspires me to stick with the hard, resistant, pinched
    parts of myself and give them care until they soften and reveal their tenderness.
    Of course, I still go off track, forget to listen to my heart, and act selfishly,
    but now I know where to come back to, where I am loved and forgiven and where
    I can forgive myself.'

- en: I look at the beautiful stone around the base of my home that is comprised of
    five different types of granite from different parts of the world and was placed
    by expert stonemasons in squares and rectangles to form a specific color pattern.
    I never stopped reading *Architectural Digest* since I first found it among my
    brother’s pile of treasures, and the image of that multicolored granite wall came
    from there. Long before I oversaw its construction, I held the picture in my mind
    and taught my subconscious to look for a way to make it a reality.

- en: 'Whereas the mansion I had lived in was cold and empty of light and joy, my
    home today is just that: a *home*. My wife’s parents, immigrants from Russia,
    live with us in a guesthouse on our property (although more often than not, they
    appear in our home unannounced, even when I’m in my underwear). Where I never
    had the chance to meet any of my grandparents, my sons have lived near theirs
    for their entire lives. Today, my father-in-law, a former engineer who oversaw
    the power system in the nation of Georgia, helps my older son with his physics
    homework, and my mother-in-law helps him with his advanced math. These are two
    subjects with which I struggled greatly in my own childhood because I had no one
    to help me. I know that tonight we will all sit in the outdoor cabana with the
    barbecue grill and pizza oven, enjoying a meal and appreciating the time we spend
    together. My sons may even take charge and be the pizza cooks for the evening.
    After dinner, we might play our favorite game, Telestrations, a kind of visual
    game of Telephone where different pictures go through hilarious and unexpected
    transformations. Often, my daughter and her husband will visit and share a meal.
    And in those moments, we will all laugh together and enjoy each other and our
    surroundings, and I will take in my joy at finding myself in the midst of the
    warm and loving family I dreamed about.'

- en: In my library, I see the framed photograph of myself, my brother and sister,
    and my parents all sitting together on the couch. It is one of only two photographs
    from my childhood. Everyone in the photo except me has passed away, and yet, I
    feel I have finally been able to give us all the home we wanted so badly, like
    Jim Carrey burying his $10 million check with his father. When I look at the photo,
    I remember where I came from and the love that we all felt for each other. I remember
    how we tried to express that love, but our circumstances made it hard to do so.
    Outside of our bedroom, there is a painting in brown hues done by my brother of
    a man lying back against a tree while playing a flute and looking out over a lake.
    No matter how often I straighten it, the painting always gets crooked in the same
    way. Although I am probably the least superstitious person I know, I have the
    sense it is my brother making it crooked each time, letting me know he is with
    me. And while I know on one level it is ridiculous to think that way, on another
    it warms my heart and reminds me our loved ones are alive for us through our memories
    of them.

- en: 'Sitting in the wreckage of my life in the empty mansion, I realized I had accomplished
    what I viewed as success, but the manifestation of that success was emptiness,
    and it caused so much pain to those I loved. I still carried the shame of my childhood
    trauma that drove me to prove myself, and to show others I was worthy; nothing
    I did was enough, for me or for them. Today, I feel overcome by gratitude for
    the good things in my life. I am thankful to have been given a second chance at
    happiness and the tools to apply what I learned from my mistakes to building a
    new life. I continue to be struck by the paradox my life has taught me: only when
    we believe we are enough in ourselves do we find the ability to contribute to
    life, but only in contributing to our world do we discover we are inherently enough.
    I believe this is what Ruth was trying to teach me all those years ago in the
    magic shop, and it has taken me a lifetime to understand it.'

- en: In my life, I have experienced the power of manifesting in ways that I cannot
    explain. When I first began the practice, I devoted all my energy and attention
    and heart to making sure my family’s rent was paid so that we would not be evicted
    from our apartment. Out of the blue, a man who owed my father for a job showed
    up at our door and handed me an envelope full of money—enough to pay our rent
    with plenty left over for food. I remember the excitement and joy I felt as I
    rushed as fast as I could on my bike, with tears in my eyes, to share the news
    with Ruth. That was my first taste of the true power of the practice. From a neuroscience
    point of view, I cannot say how I influenced the situation, but the wonder I felt
    laid the foundation for my belief in manifesting. Since then, I have had countless
    similar experiences that may defy scientific logic but nonetheless speak to the
    inner power of setting an intention in the heart and mind.

- en: It is time to break free from the illusion that keeps us from believing in the
    power of our own possibilities and the extraordinary strength we hold within ourselves,
    individually and especially together. Waiting for an external force to transform
    our lives will only distract our attention, drain our energy, and discourage our
    spirits. For many of us the path is challenging, and it can take years if not
    decades to gain the insights to know the difference between what we want and what
    we need. The techniques contained in this book were the path I took to find the
    answer. As I look out into my backyard at the headless Buddha and the persimmon
    he holds, I am again reminded to lead with my heart, and to understand that with
    time those things that caused us pain will give us wisdom and insight.

    I remember the good news: it is the realization that the universe isn’t separate
    from you but that you are the universe, and it is only you who can give a fuck.
    It is only you that can harness the power within yourself. And that is the real
    magic.'
