  zh: 回家的旅程
- en: It is the end of the day on a Friday, and I drive up the tree-lined drive to
    my home in Los Altos Hills, California. Even as I approach where I live, I begin
    to be suffused with a feeling of warmth, safety, and peace. Looking over the familiar
    scene and being greeted by my wife and sons, my heart resonates with the images
    I pictured for so long in my mind, and I know I belong here.

  zh: 在加利福尼亚州洛斯阿图斯山，星期五的日子结束，我驱车驶入树木成荫的车道。即使在接近我居住的地方时，我也开始感受到温暖、安全和宁静的气息。看着熟悉的场景，妻子和儿子向我打招呼，我的心中共鸣着我在脑海中构思了那么久的画面，我知道我属于这里。
- en: 'Where the garden at my former mansion was left to languish and wither, today
    I am surrounded by living growth: cherry, peach, olive, and pear trees, three
    varieties of apple trees, lemon trees, and an orange tree, all generously bearing
    flowers and fruit. Flanking the front of the house are the three parrotia, or
    Persian ironwood, trees that I had imported for their singular shape and color.
    I am also struck by the oak tree in the front yard that traveled from San Diego
    to be part of my home. At the time it was planted, it was ten feet high; it has
    now grown to over twenty-five feet and, like the parrotias, embraces my home with
    its branches. As I walk toward the front door, I am greeted by the soothing sound
    of water flowing over the ancient boulders into the small pond by my house, which
    tells me I can relax: I am safe. As I do almost every day, I pass by the chicken
    coop, the beehives, and the treehouse on stilts that I had built for my sons.
    It is connected to the living trees with a zip line stretched out from the roof
    across the back of the yard.'

  zh: 在我以前的豪宅中，花园被遗弃而枯萎，而今天我被生机勃勃的植物包围：樱桃树、桃树、橄榄树和梨树，三种苹果树、柠檬树和一棵橙树，所有这些树木慷慨地结满了花和果实。房子前面种着三棵我引进的波斯铁木树，因其独特的形状和颜色而特别。我还被前院的橡树所打动，它从圣地亚哥移植而来，成为我家的一部分。它种植时高达十英尺，现在已经长到超过二十五英尺，像波斯铁木一样，用它的树枝拥抱着我的家。当我走向前门时，耳边传来水流过古老岩石的悦耳声响，流入我家旁的小池塘，这让我知道我可以放松：我很安全。和几乎每天一样，我经过鸡舍、蜂箱和为我的儿子们建造的高架树屋。它与活树相连，屋顶上拉着一条滑索，跨越后院。
- en: I survey the beautiful house we live in, built in a contemporary Asian style
    according to inspiration from my travels and reading, crafted to provide a soothing
    atmosphere of tranquility. This house, too, I designed myself and envisioned over
    and over in great detail before it was constructed. When I first pictured the
    house, I knew there would be a dramatic centerpiece drawing the eye through the
    space all the way from the doorway out past the pool. Today, I see the modern
    cast-bronze statue of a headless Buddha holding a persimmon that I bought at an
    auction for the Dalai Lama Foundation seated and presiding over the backyard in
    serenity.

  zh: 我审视着我们居住的美丽房子，这座房子按照我旅行和阅读的灵感，以现代亚洲风格建造，旨在营造宁静舒适的氛围。这座房子也是我自己设计的，在建造之前我在脑海中反复构思了许多细节。当我第一次设想这座房子时，我就知道会有一个引人注目的中心点，将视线从门口一直引导到游泳池外。如今，我看到的是一座现代铸铜雕像，雕像是无头的佛陀手持柿子的形象，我在为达赖喇嘛基金会的拍卖会上购得，它安静地坐落在后院，散发着宁静。
- en: 'The truth is, staying on course is a daily struggle. I knew I would need a
    lot of help to continue listening to my own inner compass and not go off track
    again, and so my home is full of guideposts for myself. The headless bronze Buddha
    reminds me not to get lost in my head and to always go back to my heart. And the
    persimmon the Buddha holds has a powerful symbolic meaning, too: persimmons start
    out as bitter and hard, but if you are patient, they ripen to become soft and
    intensely sweet. This image inspires me to stick with the hard, resistant, pinched
    parts of myself and give them care until they soften and reveal their tenderness.
    Of course, I still go off track, forget to listen to my heart, and act selfishly,
    but now I know where to come back to, where I am loved and forgiven and where
    I can forgive myself.'

  zh: 事实是，保持方向每天都是一场斗争。我知道我需要很多帮助来继续倾听我内心的指引，而不再偏离轨道，因此我的家中充满了指引自己的标志。那个无头的铜佛提醒我不要迷失在思绪中，而要始终回到内心。而佛陀手中的柿子也有着强大的象征意义：柿子开始时是苦涩而坚硬的，但如果你有耐心，它们会变得柔软而甜美。这个形象激励我坚持对抗自己那些艰难、顽固和压抑的部分，并给予它们关怀，直到它们软化并展现出温柔。当然，我仍然会偏离轨道，忘记倾听内心，表现自私，但现在我知道该回到哪里，那是我被爱和宽恕的地方，也是我能宽恕自己的地方。
- en: I look at the beautiful stone around the base of my home that is comprised of
    five different types of granite from different parts of the world and was placed
    by expert stonemasons in squares and rectangles to form a specific color pattern.
    I never stopped reading *Architectural Digest* since I first found it among my
    brother’s pile of treasures, and the image of that multicolored granite wall came
    from there. Long before I oversaw its construction, I held the picture in my mind
    and taught my subconscious to look for a way to make it a reality.

  zh: 我看到我家周围漂亮的石头是由五种来自不同地区的花岗岩组成，经过专业石匠的手工雕刻成方形和矩形，以形成特定的色彩图案。自从我第一次在我兄弟的宝物堆中发现*建筑文摘*以来，我就从未停止阅读，而那面五彩斑斓的花岗岩墙的形象正是来自那里。在我负责其建造之前，我早已在脑海中持有这张图像，并教会我的潜意识寻找将其变为现实的方法。
- en: 'Whereas the mansion I had lived in was cold and empty of light and joy, my
    home today is just that: a *home*. My wife’s parents, immigrants from Russia,
    live with us in a guesthouse on our property (although more often than not, they
    appear in our home unannounced, even when I’m in my underwear). Where I never
    had the chance to meet any of my grandparents, my sons have lived near theirs
    for their entire lives. Today, my father-in-law, a former engineer who oversaw
    the power system in the nation of Georgia, helps my older son with his physics
    homework, and my mother-in-law helps him with his advanced math. These are two
    subjects with which I struggled greatly in my own childhood because I had no one
    to help me. I know that tonight we will all sit in the outdoor cabana with the
    barbecue grill and pizza oven, enjoying a meal and appreciating the time we spend
    together. My sons may even take charge and be the pizza cooks for the evening.
    After dinner, we might play our favorite game, Telestrations, a kind of visual
    game of Telephone where different pictures go through hilarious and unexpected
    transformations. Often, my daughter and her husband will visit and share a meal.
    And in those moments, we will all laugh together and enjoy each other and our
    surroundings, and I will take in my joy at finding myself in the midst of the
    warm and loving family I dreamed about.'

  zh: 我曾住的豪宅是冰冷的，没有光亮和欢乐，而我今天的家正是这样：一个*家*。我妻子的父母，来自俄罗斯的移民，住在我们房产上的一栋客房中（尽管他们更常常是在我穿着内裤时突然出现在我家）。我从未有机会见到我的祖父母，而我的儿子们却在他们的祖父母身边生活了一辈子。今天，我的岳父，一位曾负责格鲁吉亚国家电力系统的工程师，正在帮助我的大儿子做物理作业，而我的岳母则在帮助他进行高等数学。这两个科目在我自己的童年中我都曾苦苦挣扎，因为我没有人能帮助我。我知道今晚我们都会坐在户外的凉亭里，那里有烧烤架和披萨烤箱，享受一顿美餐，珍惜我们在一起的时光。我的儿子们甚至可能会主动成为今晚的披萨厨师。晚餐后，我们可能会玩我们最喜欢的游戏《Telestrations》，这是一种视觉版的电话游戏，不同的图片经历搞笑而意外的变形。我的女儿和她的丈夫也会常来拜访并共享一顿饭。在那些时刻，我们都会一起欢笑，享受彼此和周围的环境，而我将感受到在我梦寐以求的温暖和充满爱的家庭中找到自己的喜悦。
- en: In my library, I see the framed photograph of myself, my brother and sister,
    and my parents all sitting together on the couch. It is one of only two photographs
    from my childhood. Everyone in the photo except me has passed away, and yet, I
    feel I have finally been able to give us all the home we wanted so badly, like
    Jim Carrey burying his $10 million check with his father. When I look at the photo,
    I remember where I came from and the love that we all felt for each other. I remember
    how we tried to express that love, but our circumstances made it hard to do so.
    Outside of our bedroom, there is a painting in brown hues done by my brother of
    a man lying back against a tree while playing a flute and looking out over a lake.
    No matter how often I straighten it, the painting always gets crooked in the same
    way. Although I am probably the least superstitious person I know, I have the
    sense it is my brother making it crooked each time, letting me know he is with
    me. And while I know on one level it is ridiculous to think that way, on another
    it warms my heart and reminds me our loved ones are alive for us through our memories
    of them.

  zh: 在我的图书馆里，我看到一张框起来的照片，照片中我、我的兄弟姐妹和我的父母都坐在沙发上。这是我童年时期仅有的两张照片之一。照片中除了我以外的所有人都已经去世，然而，我感到我终于能够给我们所有人提供我们曾如此渴望的家，就像吉姆·凯瑞和他父亲一起埋掉他的1000万美元支票。当我看着这张照片时，我想起了我的出身和我们彼此之间的爱。我记得我们如何努力表达那份爱，但我们的处境让这变得困难。在我们的卧室外，有一幅我哥哥用棕色调画的画，画的是一个人靠在树上吹着笛子，眺望着湖面。无论我多么努力地把它弄直，画作总是以同样的方式歪掉。虽然我可能是我所认识的最不迷信的人，但我有种感觉，每次歪掉都是我哥哥在捣鬼，让我知道他与我同在。虽然我知道从某种程度上看，这种想法是荒谬的，但从另一个角度看，这让我感到温暖，提醒我我们的亲人通过我们对他们的记忆永远活在我们心中。
- en: 'Sitting in the wreckage of my life in the empty mansion, I realized I had accomplished
    what I viewed as success, but the manifestation of that success was emptiness,
    and it caused so much pain to those I loved. I still carried the shame of my childhood
    trauma that drove me to prove myself, and to show others I was worthy; nothing
    I did was enough, for me or for them. Today, I feel overcome by gratitude for
    the good things in my life. I am thankful to have been given a second chance at
    happiness and the tools to apply what I learned from my mistakes to building a
    new life. I continue to be struck by the paradox my life has taught me: only when
    we believe we are enough in ourselves do we find the ability to contribute to
    life, but only in contributing to our world do we discover we are inherently enough.
    I believe this is what Ruth was trying to teach me all those years ago in the
    magic shop, and it has taken me a lifetime to understand it.'

  zh: 坐在我生活的废墟中，空荡荡的豪宅里，我意识到我达成了我认为的成功，但这种成功的体现却是空虚，这给我爱的人带来了如此巨大的痛苦。我仍然背负着童年创伤的羞耻感，这驱使我去证明自己，向他人展示我值得；无论我做什么，对我或他们来说都不够。今天，我对生活中的美好事物充满感激。我感恩于获得了再次追求幸福的机会，以及能够将我从错误中学到的知识应用于建立新生活的工具。我依然为生活教给我的悖论所震撼：只有当我们相信自己足够时，我们才能找到为生活做贡献的能力，但只有在为我们的世界贡献时，我们才能发现自己本身就足够。我相信这正是鲁思多年前在魔法商店试图教我的东西，而我花了一辈子才理解这一点。
- en: In my life, I have experienced the power of manifesting in ways that I cannot
    explain. When I first began the practice, I devoted all my energy and attention
    and heart to making sure my family’s rent was paid so that we would not be evicted
    from our apartment. Out of the blue, a man who owed my father for a job showed
    up at our door and handed me an envelope full of money—enough to pay our rent
    with plenty left over for food. I remember the excitement and joy I felt as I
    rushed as fast as I could on my bike, with tears in my eyes, to share the news
    with Ruth. That was my first taste of the true power of the practice. From a neuroscience
    point of view, I cannot say how I influenced the situation, but the wonder I felt
    laid the foundation for my belief in manifesting. Since then, I have had countless
    similar experiences that may defy scientific logic but nonetheless speak to the
    inner power of setting an intention in the heart and mind.

  zh: 在我的生活中，我以无法解释的方式体验到了显化的力量。当我第一次开始这个实践时，我倾注了所有的精力、注意力和心血，以确保我家能支付房租，不至于被赶出公寓。突然，一个欠我父亲工作的男人出现在我们家门口，递给我一个装满现金的信封——足够支付房租，还剩下很多钱可以买食物。我记得那种兴奋和喜悦，当时我骑着自行车飞快地赶去和露丝分享这个消息，泪水夺眶而出。这是我第一次真正体会到这个实践的力量。从神经科学的角度来看，我无法说出我如何影响了这个情况，但我所感受到的奇迹为我对显化的信念奠定了基础。从那时起，我经历了无数类似的体验，虽然可能违背科学逻辑，但无疑诉说着在心中设定意图的内在力量。
- en: It is time to break free from the illusion that keeps us from believing in the
    power of our own possibilities and the extraordinary strength we hold within ourselves,
    individually and especially together. Waiting for an external force to transform
    our lives will only distract our attention, drain our energy, and discourage our
    spirits. For many of us the path is challenging, and it can take years if not
    decades to gain the insights to know the difference between what we want and what
    we need. The techniques contained in this book were the path I took to find the
    answer. As I look out into my backyard at the headless Buddha and the persimmon
    he holds, I am again reminded to lead with my heart, and to understand that with
    time those things that caused us pain will give us wisdom and insight.
