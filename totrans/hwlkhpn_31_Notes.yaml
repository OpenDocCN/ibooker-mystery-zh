- en: The French microbiologist Louis Pasteur saved millions of lives in the nineteenth
    century (and into today) when he figured out the process for pasteurizing milk
    and later created a vaccine against rabies. One of the first people to understand
    how germs cause disease, he refuted (incorrect) scientific ideas that had been
    around since Aristotle. To those who marveled at his breakthroughs, he famously
    pointed out that “luck favors the prepared mind.” And indeed, his discoveries
    came only after years of complex experiments in his labs in Strasbourg and Lille,
    France. With his very extensive preparation, he had a nice run of making luck
    for himself and millions of others.

    understand exponents and statistics. The question is: How many people do you need
    for it to be likely that two of them will have the same birthday? It turns out
    that once you have 23 people in a room, there’s a fifty-fifty chance of two of
    them having the same birthday. With 70 people, there’s a 99.9 percent chance.'

- en: The first stumbling block is that when you think of two people in a room having
    the same birthday, you immediately think of someone having *your* birthday. In
    that room of 23 people, you would compare yourself to the other 22 partygoers
    to see if someone shared your birthday (you to person A, you to person B, you
    to person C . . .). But that’s a very different problem! Leave yourself out of
    it, because maybe the guy next to you has the same birthday as the girl across
    the room. If you make all *those* comparisons (Person A to person B, person A
    to person C, person B to person C. . .), there are 253 chances to make a match.

- en: Mathematicians say that the simplest (well, maybe) approach is to flip the problem
    around and look at the people who do *not* share a birthday. Since there are 365
    days in a year (without February 29), the probability of person A *not* sharing
    a birthday with person B is 364/365 (or 99.7 percent). We’ve already said that
    in that room of 23, there are 253 comparisons, so the equation becomes (364/365)253.
    With a good calculator, you’ll find there’s a 49.95 chance that all 253 comparisons
    contain no matches. That means there’s a 50.05 percent chance that there *is*
    a match. Bravo! You’ve now proved that with 23 people, the odds of two people
    sharing a birthday are better than even! You can do the same math with 70 people
    and find out that the likelihood has soared to 99.9 percent. Getting to 100 percent
    is a different story. For that, you need 366 people.

    to controversy. Comments he made about intelligence and race in 2007 caused such
    dissension that he was dropped from the boards of companies and forced to retire
    from at least one academic position. He eventually felt like such a pariah that
    he put his Nobel Prize up for auction at Christie’s because, he said at the time,
    “no one really wants to admit I exist.” A Russian billionaire paid more than $4
    million to buy the medal—and then returned it to Dr. Watson, saying, “His award
    for the discovery of DNA structure must belong to him.”

    sending packages to 160 people in Omaha, Nebraska, and asking them to forward
    it to someone they knew personally—on the way to its getting to a particular stockbrocker
    in Boston. Though the project had serious flaws, Milgram concluded that the average
    package went through five intermediate hands (so six degrees first to last). But
    the idea wasn’t completely original. Hungarian author Frigyes Karinthy published
    a story in 1929 that presented the idea that any two of the (then) 1.5 billion
    people in the world could be connected through five links. This concept has had
    many iterations. In 1999, three guys appeared on *The Daily Show* with Jon Stewart
    to explain how everyone in Hollywood was connected by having worked on a movie
    (or worked with someone who worked on a movie) with actor Kevin Bacon. *Six Degrees
    of Kevin Bacon* later became a book and a board game and the theme for a TV show.
    While Bacon first tried to distance himself from the idea, he eventually embraced
    it. (How could he not? He’s zero degrees from Kevin Bacon.)
