    same way that experts recommend you diversify your financial investments. Even
    if you’re the kind of (irrational) person who thinks you can beat the market in
    picking stocks, you’re not going to plunk all your money in just one stock. Or
    at least you generally shouldn’t. Just ask the people who invested in the companies
    that became the famous flameouts of the dot-com boom, like Webvan and Pets.com.

    you didn’t feel very lucky afterward when they got scrambled.

  zh: 巴纳比指出，要想幸运，你需要在生活中进行多元化——就像专家建议你分散财务投资一样。即使你是那种（不理智的）认为自己能打败市场挑选股票的人，你也不会把所有的钱都投入一只股票里。或者至少一般不应该这么做。问问那些投资于成为
    dot-com 泡沫时期著名破产公司的人的情况，比如 Webvan 和 Pets.com。它们早期看起来很不错，但如果这些篮子里装满了你的所有鸡蛋，当它们全都打碎时，你就不会觉得自己很幸运了。
- en: A reasonable investment plan would have you put some money in bonds and some
    in stocks (and maybe a little bit in commodities), and if one portion goes down,
    another portion probably balances it out. The nice, safe, diversified strategy
    is also the one that can make you feel lucky when you’re able to retire to Palm

    happens to mention every Thanksgiving how much he’s made on the Apple stock that
    he bought way back when and has split more times than he can count. Next time
    he brings it up, ask him what else was in that original mix. Perhaps some shares
    of Pets.com he doesn’t mention? If you don’t want to ruin the whole dinner, you
    can point out that making his luck by diversifying was actually a smart strategy.
    It’s the same reason you have a pecan pie and a pumpkin pie and an apple pie on

    figure that they’ll get a return on one in ten of them. If nine bomb but one turns
    into a Microsoft or Facebook or Alibaba, everybody looks brilliant. Following
    that model, diversifying means you’re not betting the farm (or the retirement

- en: Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the mathematician and author of *Fooled by Randomness*
    and *The Black Swan*, has spent a lot of time thinking about how to set strategies
    that can make you lucky in (what he considers) a random world. What he calls “black
    swan events” are those that seem to come out of nowhere and can’t be predicted—like
    world wars and stock market crashes and terrorist attacks. Taleb gives the example
    of a Las Vegas casino that had planned for every contingency on its gambling floor
    but was almost destroyed by completely unprecedented events—a star performer was
    mauled by a tiger, an employee hid important records, and an owner’s daughter
    was kidnapped. Events like these, rare but with an extreme impact, cause disaster
    for most people who count on the status quo—but can create huge windfalls for
    others.

  zh: 数学家、*《随机的愚弄》*和*《黑天鹅》*的作者纳西姆·尼古拉斯·塔勒布，花了大量时间思考如何设定策略，使你在他认为的“随机世界”中能够变得幸运。他所称的“黑天鹅事件”是指那些看似凭空出现且无法预测的事件——比如世界大战、股市崩盘和恐怖袭击。塔勒布举了一个拉斯维加斯赌场的例子，赌场为其赌博大厅中的每一个突发情况做好了准备，却几乎被完全无法预见的事件摧毁——一位明星表演者被老虎攻击，一名员工藏匿了重要记录，一位老板的女儿被绑架。像这样的事件，虽然罕见，但会造成极大的影响，它们会为那些依赖现状的人带来灾难——但却可能为另一些人带来巨大的好运。
- en: Taleb’s view is that if you want to get lucky from black swans, you should invest
    in the extremes. Think of it as the barbell school of life, in which you stay
    away from the middle and load up on things at either end that are extremely safe
    and extremely risky. So, for example, you might squirrel away 90 percent of your
    savings in something like well-protected Treasury bonds and then put the remaining
    amount—the amount you’re willing to lose—in extremely high-risk possibilities
    like Bitcoin or oil wells in Alaska. If you like the idea of the big chance, it’s
    a good plan. But most of us would rather be a little more cautious. Betting on
    black swans is one theoretical way to create luck—but if you’re not careful about
    how much you’re willing to risk, you can end up broke (or crazed with anxiety)
    long before the black swan appears.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 塔勒布的观点是，如果你想通过黑天鹅获得幸运，你应该投资于极端的领域。把它看作是一种生活中的杠铃策略，在这种策略中，你远离中间位置，将资金集中在两端，一端是极其安全的，另一端是极其高风险的。所以，比如说，你可能把90%的储蓄存入像国债这样的非常安全的投资工具里，然后将剩余的部分——你愿意承担的损失——投入到像比特币或阿拉斯加油井这样的极高风险的投资中。如果你喜欢这种大机会的想法，那是一个不错的计划。但大多数人还是更愿意保持一点谨慎。押注黑天鹅是一种理论上的方式来创造幸运——但如果你不小心，不小心估计你愿意承担的风险，你可能会在黑天鹅出现之前就破产（或者因焦虑而发疯）。
- en: So in both finances and life, you can either diversify with a normal, middle-of-the-road
    approach or go to the extremes that Taleb suggests. But there’s not a mathematician
    or analyst around who would recommend anything *other* than diversifying in most

    had been unceremoniously fired from the top spot at a hugely popular women’s magazine.
    In the merry-go-round of media, that happens regularly, and it certainly wouldn’t
    be a black mark against her. But she had loved that particular job, and losing

    little moments that add up.” If one or two more people had said yes to financing,
    he’d still be going strong. Or maybe it was the split with his girlfriend that
    distracted him and affected his attitude. “Business is about people, so emotion
    always plays a role,” he said. Over the company’s three years, they’d had big

    Barnaby was still surprised by the sunsetting. From what he’d seen early on, Alex
    had done everything right. He’d brought in top talent and planned his moves carefully.
    “Maybe that changed his chance of success from one in a hundred to one in two,

    closed, he could pack up and take six months to explore New Zealand and Fiji and

    good route to getting lucky. But surely there were exceptions. I started my career
    as a sportswriter and regularly heard coaches thunder about the need to give 110

  zh: “那么你认为是什么让你们保持幸运的？”我问。“你们是怎么做到的？”
- en: “What made us lucky is all this,” he said, gesturing toward the arena floor
    where the college wrestlers were on the mats competing. “Jim was a wrestler—an
    NCAA champion—and he never gives up. He spent years developing dogged persistence
    and tenacity. He’s the same in business as he was on the mat—patient and purposeful,
    and he waits for the right opening. Then he has incredible stamina and doesn’t
    mind hurting a little bit. Wrestlers always have something that hurts. But Jim
    figures out every move and has staying power.”

  zh: “让我们幸运的就是这些，”他说着，指向竞技场的地板，那里大学摔跤选手正在垫子上比赛。“吉姆是摔跤手——一位NCAA冠军——他从不放弃。他花了多年时间培养了顽强的毅力和韧性。他在商业上的表现和他在摔跤场上的一样——耐心、有目标，他等待着正确的时机。然后他拥有惊人的耐力，哪怕有点小痛也不在乎。摔跤选手总是会有某些地方痛。但是吉姆能想出每一个动作，并且有坚持到底的力量。”

- en: Sitting down a few minutes later with a beer (for him) and a Diet Coke (for
    me), I told Jim what his colleague had said. Jim gave a little smile. “Wrestling
    does train you to be persistent, and maybe that helps in business,” he said. He
    knows some other wrestlers who had gone on to big success on Wall Street, and
    the step-by-step approach he took to wrestling had surely helped when he was evaluating
    companies. “Maybe I was willing to be more methodical and spend more time studying
    details than most people,” he said. At least a third of Jim’s competitors went
    out of business in the 2008 recession, but he didn’t panic and got through just
    fine. “You keep working and looking for opportunities and trying to make your
    luck,” he said.

  zh: 几分钟后，我和吉姆一起坐下来，手里拿着啤酒（他喝）和健怡可乐（我喝），我告诉他他的同事说了什么。吉姆微微一笑。“摔跤确实培养了你的坚持力，也许这对做生意有帮助，”他说。他认识一些其他摔跤手，后来在华尔街取得了巨大成功，而他在摔跤中的一步步方法，肯定帮助他在评估公司时做出了正确的决策。“也许我愿意比大多数人更有条理，并花更多时间研究细节，”他说。吉姆的大约三分之一的竞争对手在2008年的经济衰退中破产，但他没有惊慌，反而顺利度过了难关。“你要不断工作，寻找机会，努力制造属于自己的运气，”他说。
- en: It struck me that Jim was a serial eggs-in-basket guy. He threw himself fully
    into whatever he was doing—but always had that next egg hatching. He had focused
    intently and worked endlessly to become an NCAA champion—but he was still at an
    Ivy League school and studied hard. He did well enough to get into Harvard Business
    School and set up his next round of luck. Now he brought incredible intensity
    to his business, but he also took ten weeks of vacation a year, spending time
    with his delightfully ebullient wife and their young children.

  zh: 我突然意识到，吉姆是那种典型的“篮子里有好多蛋”的人。他全身心投入到自己正在做的事情中——但总是会有下一个“蛋”在孵化。他曾全力以赴地投入训练，成为了NCAA冠军——但他仍在常春藤学校深造并努力学习。他努力得足够好，成功进入了哈佛商学院，为下一个幸运机会做准备。现在他以令人难以置信的专注投入到自己的事业中，但他每年也会休假十周，陪伴他充满活力的妻子和他们的孩子们。

  zh: “当你每周工作七十到八十个小时时，你可能会感到精疲力尽。我想继续下去，”他说道。
- en: Wrestling was still a big part of his life. In fact, he had just been named
    the team leader for the USA women’s team at the 2020 Olympics. But always modest,
    he didn’t want to take too much credit for his long-ago national championship.
    Understanding my concept that luck was based on talent, hard work, and random
    chance, he suggested that he’d needed all three.

  zh: 摔跤依然是他生活中的重要部分。事实上，他刚刚被任命为2020年东京奥运会美国女子摔跤队的队长。但一贯谦虚的他并不想为自己很久以前的全国冠军荣誉占太多功劳。他理解我关于运气的看法——运气是基于天赋、努力和随机因素的结合，他认为自己需要三者齐全。
- en: “Everyone who gets to the top level has talent and works hard,” he said, “but
    when you get to those last matches, something can just go your way or not.”

- en: After a while, Jim got up to return to his hosting duties, and I sidled over
    to the ringside seats to watch the college wrestlers on the mats below. Jim was
    probably right that some chance would be involved, as it always is in sports—a
    bad call, an unexpected injury. But as a general rule, the best wrestlers would
    win their medals through a combination of talent, hard work, and determination.

  zh: 过了一会儿，吉姆站起来准备回到他的主持工作，我悄悄走到场边的座位上，观看下面摔跤垫上的大学摔跤手。吉姆可能是对的，比赛中总是会涉及到一些运气因素——比如一个错误的判罚，或是意外的伤病。但作为一般规则，最优秀的摔跤手会凭借天赋、努力和决心赢得奖牌。
- en: The winners would be very proud. They deserved to be. They had trained in the
    gym for hours, run on the streets for miles, and probably eaten celery for days
    in order to make weight. They’d given all they had to the sport. But I hoped that
    they also understood that life was long and college wrestling would end—and that
    (like Jim at the same age) they had another egg hatching in their basket, preparing
    them for the next stage of life.

  zh: 胜利者会非常自豪，他们理应如此。他们在健身房里训练了数小时，在街上跑了好几英里，可能为了控制体重已经连续好几天只吃芹菜。他们已经把所有的精力都投入到了这项运动中。但我希望他们也明白，人生是漫长的，大学摔跤终将结束——而且（像吉姆在那个年龄时一样）他们的篮子里还有另一个正在孵化的“蛋”，为他们的下一阶段人生做准备。
- en: After I gave Jim a hug good-bye, I left Madison Square Garden thinking how life
    is both shorter and longer than you realize. Shorter for all the obvious reasons
    (*Was college that long ago?*) and longer because you have more cycles and opportunities
    and chances than you realize when you’re starting out. If you want to be lucky,
    you have to both throw yourself fully into the moment and also be prepared for
    the future. That takes a couple of eggs and a couple of baskets—and just might
    be the formula for a lucky life.

  zh: 在我与吉姆告别并给他一个拥抱后，我离开了麦迪逊广场花园，心里想着，生活比你意识到的既更短暂又更漫长。短暂，是因为所有显而易见的原因（*大学毕业居然已经这么久了？*），而漫长，则是因为你在开始时并未意识到，自己拥有更多的周期、机会和可能性。如果你想变得幸运，就必须全身心投入到当下，同时也要为未来做好准备。这需要一些鸡蛋和一些篮子——这可能就是幸运人生的公式。
