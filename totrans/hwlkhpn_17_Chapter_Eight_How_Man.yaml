    same way that experts recommend you diversify your financial investments. Even
    if you’re the kind of (irrational) person who thinks you can beat the market in
    picking stocks, you’re not going to plunk all your money in just one stock. Or
    at least you generally shouldn’t. Just ask the people who invested in the companies
    that became the famous flameouts of the dot-com boom, like Webvan and Pets.com.
    Sure, they looked good early on, but if one of those baskets held all your eggs,
    you didn’t feel very lucky afterward when they got scrambled.

    in stocks (and maybe a little bit in commodities), and if one portion goes down,
    another portion probably balances it out. The nice, safe, diversified strategy

    Springs and sip a mai tai cocktail while lounging on your deck.

    the same time that didn’t go anywhere. People do that regularly. Maybe your brother-in-law
    happens to mention every Thanksgiving how much he’s made on the Apple stock that
    he bought way back when and has split more times than he can count. Next time
    he brings it up, ask him what else was in that original mix. Perhaps some shares
    of Pets.com he doesn’t mention? If you don’t want to ruin the whole dinner, you
    can point out that making his luck by diversifying was actually a smart strategy.
    It’s the same reason you have a pecan pie and a pumpkin pie and an apple pie on

    be the best. (Yes, this also creates an excuse to take a slice of each.)

- en: Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the mathematician and author of *Fooled by Randomness*
    and *The Black Swan*, has spent a lot of time thinking about how to set strategies
    that can make you lucky in (what he considers) a random world. What he calls “black
    swan events” are those that seem to come out of nowhere and can’t be predicted—like
    world wars and stock market crashes and terrorist attacks. Taleb gives the example
    of a Las Vegas casino that had planned for every contingency on its gambling floor
    but was almost destroyed by completely unprecedented events—a star performer was
    mauled by a tiger, an employee hid important records, and an owner’s daughter
    was kidnapped. Events like these, rare but with an extreme impact, cause disaster
    for most people who count on the status quo—but can create huge windfalls for
    others.
  id: totrans-25
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Taleb’s view is that if you want to get lucky from black swans, you should invest
    in the extremes. Think of it as the barbell school of life, in which you stay
    away from the middle and load up on things at either end that are extremely safe
    and extremely risky. So, for example, you might squirrel away 90 percent of your
    savings in something like well-protected Treasury bonds and then put the remaining
    amount—the amount you’re willing to lose—in extremely high-risk possibilities
    like Bitcoin or oil wells in Alaska. If you like the idea of the big chance, it’s
    a good plan. But most of us would rather be a little more cautious. Betting on
    black swans is one theoretical way to create luck—but if you’re not careful about
    how much you’re willing to risk, you can end up broke (or crazed with anxiety)
    long before the black swan appears.
  id: totrans-26
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in both finances and life, you can either diversify with a normal, middle-of-the-road
    approach or go to the extremes that Taleb suggests. But there’s not a mathematician
    or analyst around who would recommend anything *other* than diversifying in most
    circumstances.

    eggs in your basket (or many different baskets) sets you up to be lucky. You have
    more opportunities for success. If you break one egg, you still have several others,
    smooth and shiny and ready to go.

    other similar game shows), where the more you risk, the luckier you can get. If

    which he started in 1971, but over the next couple of years, fuel prices started
    going up and the company’s finances went down. On the verge of bankruptcy and

    of gambling. He had been building the foundations for his company for years. As
    an undergraduate, he wrote a paper for an economics class about automation and
    transportation and how you could deliver stuff by small planes. He later joked
    that he didn’t remember his grade but guessed it was probably his “usual C.”[*](51_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1)
    After he graduated from Yale, he spent three years in the Marines, flying in planes
    (though he wasn’t a pilot) and learning military logistics. All that helped when
    he started what was then Federal Express.

    afterward. The notion of gambling it all in Vegas makes an excellent fable, but

    his wisdom a few years ago were four guys getting their MBA who had an idea to
    sell eyeglasses online. He was happy to talk with them, but when they asked him
    to invest, he wanted to be sure that they were fully devoted to their idea. So
    he asked if they had taken internships the previous summer. Well, yes, they had.

    their time and make good decisions. (They tested two thousand names before they
    settled on Warby Parker.) However hard they worked on the company, they were also
    going to classes and thinking about other options—which probably gave them a more
    expansive view of their own company. As Dave Gilboa, one of the company’s co-CEOs,
    somewhat awkwardly explained a while ago, “Warby Parker wasn’t the basket that
    I wanted to put all my eggs into.”

    Those extra eggs in baskets they kept around don’t get mentioned anymore. Smart
    guys, they know what the start-up legend is supposed to be, so they focus on how
    hard they worked and how little they slept, how they zeroed in on unpacking boxes
    and responding to consumers to the exclusion of schoolwork and paying attention
    in class. It’s all true and very inspiring, but I’m glad Adam Grant is willing
    to remind us of the other side. You need to focus and take some risks to get lucky—but

    wasn’t her first experience as an editor in chief, and a few years earlier, she
    had been unceremoniously fired from the top spot at a hugely popular women’s magazine.
    In the merry-go-round of media, that happens regularly, and it certainly wouldn’t
    be a black mark against her. But she had loved that particular job, and losing

    office except a box in one desk drawer with my makeup and a hairbrush and a few

    as did mine, and we’ve both moved on to other projects that make us happy. But
    thinking about our positions, it occurred to me that part of luck was enjoying
    where you were at the moment. If your backup plan felt more important than real

    distracted him and affected his attitude. “Business is about people, so emotion
    always plays a role,” he said. Over the company’s three years, they’d had big

    “Maybe that changed his chance of success from one in a hundred to one in two,

    risk-taking and diversification. He found that for eons, biology has shown the
    value of diversification, and more recently, successful financial institutions
    and investors had demonstrated the same. So the question—how many eggs and how
    many baskets were optimal? He didn’t have a single answer, because a lot depended
    on your talents, aspirations, and appetite for risk. But he’d come up with a few
    general principles.

    The simplest plan was two similar options—a primary and a fallback, as Alex had
    done. But you could also throw in a third option that was completely different,
    in case the first two failed for the same reason.

    closed, he could pack up and take six months to explore New Zealand and Fiji and
    Bora Bora (or wherever he wanted). Options aren’t always about having one job
    or another. They’re about seeing that life offers many different opportunities,
    and luck comes from taking the different paths that will make you happy.

- en: Having two options, with a possible outlier third option, seemed like a generally
    good route to getting lucky. But surely there were exceptions. I started my career
    as a sportswriter and regularly heard coaches thunder about the need to give 110
    percent. If you were coming up to bat in the World Series with the score tied
    at the bottom of the ninth inning, you weren’t going to think about a backup plan.
    You focused everything you possibly could on that single at bat.

    to put all your eggs in one basket,” he said. The first was where the payoff was
    so high or the opportunity so narrow that you needed to throw caution to the wind.
    That would include the ninth inning of the World Series or, as Barnaby suggested,
    when you’re trying to win an Olympic medal or the love of a special person.

    It occurred to me that when we’re in the midst of one adventure, we don’t realize
    how many more are to come. Maybe we can make ourselves lucky by plopping those
    eggs into our baskets one after another, rather than all at once.

    seen each other in a long time, but we would always be bonded by wrestling. No,
    not *that* kind of wrestling—we were just good friends. But one of my first assignments
    for the college newspaper was covering the varsity wrestling team, and Jim was
    one of the stars. It was a fun beat because the wrestlers were smart and determined
    and incredibly driven (with great biceps, too). It got even better when Jim won
    the National Collegiate Athletic Association wrestling championship—which was
    an impressively big deal.[*](53_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_3) He was as close to
    a campus hero as a wrestler can get.

    this year at Madison Square Garden and he had purchased a suite for the three-day
    event. Did I want to come by? Some members of the old college team would be there,
    as well as some of Jim’s current colleagues.

    Jim’s spacious suite, which had plenty of seats facing the arena, a large comfy
    area for chatting, and a big center table filled with enough beer and wine and
    snacks to make it a good night. Jim looked fit and happy and not too far above
    the weight class in which he once competed. After college, he had worked for financial
    firms and then started his own company, Bennett Management. Given the suite, which
    was usually leased to big corporations, my best guess was that he had achieved
    the financial equivalent of an NCAA championship.

    with a guy who had been a top executive at Jim’s company. He told me that Jim
    invested in distressed assets and at one point had two billion dollars under management.
    It was a tough, competitive business, and several other similar companies that
    had started at the same time had since folded.

    where the college wrestlers were on the mats competing. “Jim was a wrestler—an
    NCAA champion—and he never gives up. He spent years developing dogged persistence
    and tenacity. He’s the same in business as he was on the mat—patient and purposeful,
    and he waits for the right opening. Then he has incredible stamina and doesn’t
    mind hurting a little bit. Wrestlers always have something that hurts. But Jim
    figures out every move and has staying power.”

    me), I told Jim what his colleague had said. Jim gave a little smile. “Wrestling
    does train you to be persistent, and maybe that helps in business,” he said. He
    knows some other wrestlers who had gone on to big success on Wall Street, and
    the step-by-step approach he took to wrestling had surely helped when he was evaluating
    companies. “Maybe I was willing to be more methodical and spend more time studying
    details than most people,” he said. At least a third of Jim’s competitors went
    out of business in the 2008 recession, but he didn’t panic and got through just
    fine. “You keep working and looking for opportunities and trying to make your
    luck,” he said.

    into whatever he was doing—but always had that next egg hatching. He had focused
    intently and worked endlessly to become an NCAA champion—but he was still at an
    Ivy League school and studied hard. He did well enough to get into Harvard Business
    School and set up his next round of luck. Now he brought incredible intensity
    to his business, but he also took ten weeks of vacation a year, spending time
    with his delightfully ebullient wife and their young children.

    he didn’t want to take too much credit for his long-ago national championship.
    Understanding my concept that luck was based on talent, hard work, and random
    chance, he suggested that he’d needed all three.

    to the ringside seats to watch the college wrestlers on the mats below. Jim was
    probably right that some chance would be involved, as it always is in sports—a
    bad call, an unexpected injury. But as a general rule, the best wrestlers would
    win their medals through a combination of talent, hard work, and determination.

    they also understood that life was long and college wrestling would end—and that
    (like Jim at the same age) they had another egg hatching in their basket, preparing
    them for the next stage of life.

    is both shorter and longer than you realize. Shorter for all the obvious reasons
    (*Was college that long ago?*) and longer because you have more cycles and opportunities
    and chances than you realize when you’re starting out. If you want to be lucky,
    you have to both throw yourself fully into the moment and also be prepared for
    the future. That takes a couple of eggs and a couple of baskets—and just might
    be the formula for a lucky life.

  zh: 在我与吉姆告别并给他一个拥抱后，我离开了麦迪逊广场花园，心里想着，生活比你意识到的既更短暂又更漫长。短暂，是因为所有显而易见的原因（*大学毕业居然已经这么久了？*），而漫长，则是因为你在开始时并未意识到，自己拥有更多的周期、机会和可能性。如果你想变得幸运，就必须全身心投入到当下，同时也要为未来做好准备。这需要一些鸡蛋和一些篮子——这可能就是幸运人生的公式。
