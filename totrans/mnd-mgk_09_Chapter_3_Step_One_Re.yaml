    in Calabazas Park, a looped sequence of acres and acres of rollers and berms—swoopy,
    banked turns—designed to maximize momentum, where adventurous cyclists can ride
    with focus and practice tricks. At thirteen, Amari was the smaller challenger,
    craning his neck to meet the gaze of the fifteen-year-old, over-six-foot Shaun.
    As the two young men stood there frozen in conflict, eyes locked on each other,
    wheels hummed while riders swished by, up and down the small hills, hooting exuberantly
    as they popped wheelies, bunny hopped, and launched over ramps into 360-degree
    spins. Amari and Shaun were there that day to participate in a summer program
    for neurodivergent students called F+, which stands for Fun Positive. This program
    combines outdoor activities like dirt biking and dodgeball with improvisational

- en: Leading this spirited gathering were Dr. Lois Prislovsky, a trained psychologist
    and expert in ADHD, and Colin Maslan, a former bike mechanic, EMT, teacher, and
    social worker. Dr. Lois and Colin had met during compassion cultivation training
    at the Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education (CCARE), the
    center I founded at Stanford, and they shared with me how they bonded over their
    “redneck proclivities’’ for BMX biking and snowboarding, as well as a passionate
    desire to work with youth who were underserved by the conventional educational
    system. Normally, children diagnosed with multiple behavioral and learning disability
    issues would be doomed to a summer of dreary analytical worksheets and lifeless
    PowerPoint presentations, all of it in the indoor imprisonment of sterile classrooms.
    Many of these students are on the autism spectrum and have experienced the slew
    of challenges faced by neurodiverse young people. Some had been bullied, others
    had been the bullies. Some were nonverbal, others suffered from trichotillomania,
    pulling out the hair on their heads or their eyebrows or eyelashes. For most of
    them, social interaction was painful, and few of them had any real-life friends.
    In Lois’s view, the system had overpathologized them without listening for what
    it could do to truly serve their growth and well-being.

    And dirt biking. People with ADHD—whether they’re teenagers, soldiers, athletes,
    adventurers, or X-games participants—have diffused attention because their brains

    about two or three minutes long, combining compassion meditation with hypnotherapy.
    After getting their ya-yas out on the pump track and exploding water balloons
    over one another’s heads, the students practiced these meditations in short bursts
    in hammocks, up in trees, and on swings. They practiced relaxing their entire
    bodies, gathering and concentrating their minds, and directing their intention
    to the kind of person they wanted to be. The exercise on the pump track let them
    blow off steam and gave them the dopamine hit they needed to be still and practice
    their inner work.

    Amari by one of the nicknames he hated, over and over again. Amari had brushed

    in a particular negative way to a particular external stimulus is just a pattern

    ranging from high-level cognition (thinking, learning, remembering, reasoning,
    and paying attention) to low-level sensory and motor systems. The sense of agency
    is just that: a *sense* that is constructed by our brains from a combination of
    cues in our experience. The brain examines whether our actions appear to be causing
    the results we intend them to and influencing our environment as we choose, and
    then uses that data to assess whether we have agency in the situation. The humbling
    truth is that our conscious mind does not have access to most of the subconscious
    processes by which we carry out actions (such as our ability to perform movements),
    and therefore it can only set an intention, watch its effects, and then interpret
    them accordingly. In other words, our sense of agency is a *story* our brain tells
    us about our experience. When the story the brain tells us is that we do not have
    the power to perform the actions necessary to influence our circumstances for

    *nosos* (“disease”) and *gnosis* (“knowledge”), so patients with anosognosia do
    not know or realize they have a particular disease or impairment. One example
    is hemiplegia, which describes patients who are paralyzed, usually following a

- en: Researchers at the University of Turin examining such patients made a surprising
    discovery. One woman presented severe and persistent anosognosia for the paralysis
    on her left side. She never spontaneously reported her motor problems. When questioned
    about her left arm, she always claimed that it could move without any problem.
    When asked to actually perform movements with it, she attempted to perform the
    action, and after a few seconds she appeared to be satisfied with her performance.
    This woman experienced a sense of agency for movements she was unable to make.
    Despite all evidence to the contrary, she truly believed she was able to move
    her paralyzed arm. The researchers concluded that the experience of agency in
    patients like these is strongly governed by cues in the brain that precede movement,
    such as intentions and predictions of action, *not* the actual actions themselves.

    insula) that are uniquely associated with self-reflection and that facilitate
    both internal focus and sustained attention in the presence of adverse (e.g.,
    cold) external stimuli. In other words, Hof’s mental *attitude* of confidence

  zh: 重新夺回我们力量的第一步是退后一步，观察火车。尽管这听起来可能违背直觉，甚至愚蠢，但火车即将越过悬崖的那一刻，正是我们最能从意识到自己的思想中受益的时刻。通过练习，我们发现能够客观地、没有情感依附地看待自己的思维。当我们把自己置于火车站而不是在急速行驶的火车上时，我们可以观察那些飞驰而过的思想。清晰地看到我们的思想是什么，是打破无助幻觉的第一道裂缝。当我们冷静到足以清晰地看到它们时，我们会有一个惊人的发现：刺激与我们的反应之间是有间隙的。随着我们练习的时间变长，这些间隙会逐渐扩大，我们在如何选择对待我们的思想方面获得越来越多的主动权。
- en: Because the fight, flight, or freeze response often manifests in our conscious
    mind as rapid-fire, high-volume negativity, the most powerful place to cultivate
    the sense of inner power, and the most ready-to-hand, is in learning to detach
    emotionally from our thoughts. When we realize the tricks that evolution and our
    own physiology have created to make us do certain things or use shortcuts in how
    we think of things or respond to them, we become empowered to perform a kind of
    “manual override.” When we become aware of the tricks, and see them for what they
    are, we can start changing them.

  zh: 由于战斗、逃跑或僵住反应常常在我们的意识中表现为快速、高强度的负面情绪，因此培养内在力量的最强大、最容易获得的地方，就是学习从我们的思想中情感上抽离。当我们意识到进化和我们自身生理所创造的技巧，使我们做某些事情或在思考或应对事物时使用捷径时，我们就能获得执行一种“手动覆盖”的能力。当我们意识到这些技巧，并看清它们是什么时，我们就可以开始改变它们。

    to yourself, “But this is all happening *to* me. I am the victim; I do not have
    the agency and I am making my situation worse with all my negative thinking.”
    And I am saying, “The truth is that your thoughts are influencing your reality.
    But you have more power over your thoughts than you think, and for that very reason,
    you have more influence over your reality.” I encourage you, when you take stock
    of your life and consider how to move forward, do not stop at negative external
    circumstances. Take the inner attitude into account. Do not take external environmental
    evidence as conclusive or some kind of prophecy of the only things to come. Every

- en: Don’t get me wrong, experiencing the unpleasant physical sensations of your
    habitual negative rumination is highly uncomfortable. It can be excruciating and
    make us want to run for the hills, or regress to our old coping mechanisms. It
    is a monumental task that requires tremendous discipline and support. For those
    who are negatively affected by systemic oppression on a societal level, the task
    of liberating the mind from habitual fear can feel all the more like swimming
    against the current, because powerful and often violent forces of prejudice are
    mustered against their sense of individual sovereignty.

- en: However, once you understand that you can relate to your thought processes moment
    by moment with much greater clarity and power, you can begin experimenting with
    thoughts that produce a good reality. You will begin to learn how, if you think
    and act in your old way, it produces one version of reality, and if you learn
    your lesson and choose otherwise, it produces another, more desirable one. The
    magic of the process is that it’s the same hardware. When you set your mind to
    a good result, the pathway is exactly the same, but the software is updated through
    positive neurofeedback. As the Stoic philosopher Epictetus said, it is not events
    that disturb people, it is their judgments concerning them. It only requires you
    to take the first step.
