    in Calabazas Park, a looped sequence of acres and acres of rollers and berms—swoopy,
    banked turns—designed to maximize momentum, where adventurous cyclists can ride
    with focus and practice tricks. At thirteen, Amari was the smaller challenger,
    craning his neck to meet the gaze of the fifteen-year-old, over-six-foot Shaun.
    As the two young men stood there frozen in conflict, eyes locked on each other,
    wheels hummed while riders swished by, up and down the small hills, hooting exuberantly
    as they popped wheelies, bunny hopped, and launched over ramps into 360-degree
    spins. Amari and Shaun were there that day to participate in a summer program
    for neurodivergent students called F+, which stands for Fun Positive. This program
    combines outdoor activities like dirt biking and dodgeball with improvisational
    games and meditation training.

    and expert in ADHD, and Colin Maslan, a former bike mechanic, EMT, teacher, and
    social worker. Dr. Lois and Colin had met during compassion cultivation training
    at the Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education (CCARE), the
    center I founded at Stanford, and they shared with me how they bonded over their
    “redneck proclivities’’ for BMX biking and snowboarding, as well as a passionate
    desire to work with youth who were underserved by the conventional educational
    system. Normally, children diagnosed with multiple behavioral and learning disability
    issues would be doomed to a summer of dreary analytical worksheets and lifeless
    PowerPoint presentations, all of it in the indoor imprisonment of sterile classrooms.
    Many of these students are on the autism spectrum and have experienced the slew
    of challenges faced by neurodiverse young people. Some had been bullied, others
    had been the bullies. Some were nonverbal, others suffered from trichotillomania,
    pulling out the hair on their heads or their eyebrows or eyelashes. For most of
    them, social interaction was painful, and few of them had any real-life friends.
    In Lois’s view, the system had overpathologized them without listening for what
    it could do to truly serve their growth and well-being.

    in hammocks, up in trees, and on swings. They practiced relaxing their entire
    bodies, gathering and concentrating their minds, and directing their intention
    to the kind of person they wanted to be. The exercise on the pump track let them
    blow off steam and gave them the dopamine hit they needed to be still and practice
    their inner work.

    Amari by one of the nicknames he hated, over and over again. Amari had brushed
    it off at first, excited to learn how to keep his balance as the hoverboard swooshed

    someone else is driving, either with no intended destination or toward a place

    exploit a psychological phenomenon known as a *variable ratio reinforcement* schedule.
    Imagine a rat in a cage who is taught that if it presses a particular lever three
    times, it will be rewarded with a food pellet. Now imagine a lever that produces
    a food pellet at random—sometimes it takes only one press, other times it takes
    five, other times fifteen. The rat quickly catches on that the faster it pushes
    the lever, the sooner it will get the next pellet. This is also the principle

    out the pattern that governs the variable rewards. The brain of a compulsive gambler
    releases dopamine, a reward chemical, to motivate the gambler to pay attention
    to the seemingly causal connection between pulling the lever and winning the jackpot.
    Near misses, such as two cherries but not three, deepen the compulsion to keep
    playing. The apparent causal connection forms between the motivation to seek reward
    and the deployment of our attention. This is called *incentive salience*, and
    it creates a pattern of activation in the brain that resembles drug addiction,

    in a particular negative way to a particular external stimulus is just a pattern
    of physical, mental, and emotional signals that have become wired together through
    frequent, unexamined use. Over time, our minds adapt to this ceaseless automatic
    activity and no longer offer us opportunities for conscious choice. In a sense,
    it is a subconscious type of negative flow state. When our brain stops believing

    through our own actions or our will.

    adaptable than we might commonly believe and is composed of a variety of elements
    ranging from high-level cognition (thinking, learning, remembering, reasoning,
    and paying attention) to low-level sensory and motor systems. The sense of agency
    is just that: a *sense* that is constructed by our brains from a combination of
    cues in our experience. The brain examines whether our actions appear to be causing
    the results we intend them to and influencing our environment as we choose, and
    then uses that data to assess whether we have agency in the situation. The humbling
    truth is that our conscious mind does not have access to most of the subconscious
    processes by which we carry out actions (such as our ability to perform movements),
    and therefore it can only set an intention, watch its effects, and then interpret
    them accordingly. In other words, our sense of agency is a *story* our brain tells
    us about our experience. When the story the brain tells us is that we do not have
    the power to perform the actions necessary to influence our circumstances for
    the better, we feel disheartened and lose our motivation; when the story tells
    us we do have the capacity to act on our desires, we feel empowered, confident,

    science of how the sense of agency may be present even when physical agency is

    with a condition known as *anosognosia*. *Anosognosia* comes from the Greek words
    *nosos* (“disease”) and *gnosis* (“knowledge”), so patients with anosognosia do
    not know or realize they have a particular disease or impairment. One example
    is hemiplegia, which describes patients who are paralyzed, usually following a
    stroke. If the stroke also affects those areas of the brain associated with integration
    of self-awareness, these patients may be unaware on a conscious level that their
    movements are impaired.

    discovery. One woman presented severe and persistent anosognosia for the paralysis
    on her left side. She never spontaneously reported her motor problems. When questioned
    about her left arm, she always claimed that it could move without any problem.
    When asked to actually perform movements with it, she attempted to perform the
    action, and after a few seconds she appeared to be satisfied with her performance.
    This woman experienced a sense of agency for movements she was unable to make.
    Despite all evidence to the contrary, she truly believed she was able to move
    her paralyzed arm. The researchers concluded that the experience of agency in
    patients like these is strongly governed by cues in the brain that precede movement,
    such as intentions and predictions of action, *not* the actual actions themselves.
    The story the woman’s brain was telling her about her power to act was radically
    different from her physical reality.

    future chapters, the feeling of inner power is ultimately the feeling of being
    able to direct the full capacity of our brain toward an intention we choose, in
    particular harnessing the power of our subconscious. And the strange thing about
    the subconscious is that it runs on beliefs. What we subconsciously believe is
    often what limits the possibilities of a given situation. There may be a large
    gap between a person’s feeling of inner power and their ability to express that

    so much of our behavior is governed by forces and influences not apparent to the
    conscious mind, while others argue that all actions are predicated on the interaction
    of molecules, atoms, and particles, and therefore every event is predetermined—we
    just ignorantly *think* we are causing our own actions. I am not intending to
    solve this age-old debate. And happily, for the purposes of our discussion of
    manifesting, we do not have to solve it. I am simply indicating that we do have
    choices regarding how we manipulate processes within ourselves to manifest our
    intentions. It is this cognitive control, rooted in the functioning of the CEN,
    that enables our ability to adjust and direct cognitive resources to complete
    the goal-directed task of embedding our intention into the subconscious and therefore
    optimizing our ability to manifest. One must focus one’s attention and make salient
    that which one wishes to embed in the subconscious by first embedding it into
    one’s working memory. It is sustained selective attention through what is called
    *effortful control* that results in its power to embed in the subconscious.

    sit with unpleasantness and not turn away from it reflexively. By being able to
    do so, we understand that it is by reclaiming the power to choose our response
    to discomfort that we access our power to manifest. Consider the example of a
    Tibetan monk practicing Tummo meditation, a combination of forceful breathing
    and meditative visualization of flames in certain parts of the body that is often

    their heart rate, maintain a consistent body temperature even while submerged
    in ice, and manipulate other physiological processes that most people would argue
    you cannot consciously access. You, too, can access a whole host of processes
    that appear to be impossible to access consciously or seem impenetrably automatic.
    All you need is the right training. We must learn to resist the highly natural
    urge to escape or deny our discomfort, and instead develop the capacity to stay

    insula) that are uniquely associated with self-reflection and that facilitate
    both internal focus and sustained attention in the presence of adverse (e.g.,
    cold) external stimuli. In other words, Hof’s mental *attitude* of confidence
    and fearlessness about the experience allows him to activate his upper-level capacity
    for focus, which in turn diminishes his sense of time and space, skillfully drawing
    his attention away from unpleasant physical sensations and tricking his body into
    skipping its normal threat response. As a result, he enters and remains in a kind
    of flow state.

    the external environment, with practice it is possible for us to recognize our
    conditioning for what it is, and disidentify from it little by little. Inner power
    arises when a person learns to discern between their negative conditioning and
    their inner awareness, and thereby discovers that the emotional reaction is conditioned
    and not hardwired. The discomfort in the body and in the mind gradually loosen
    as their sense of identification with their habits dissolves.

    Although loud and compelling to the survival systems of the brain, these uncomfortable
    feelings, which often derive from painful childhood experiences, are in the end
    just mental habits often created to protect our childhood self. It is these habits
    learned as children that determine how we respond to so many experiences we face
    as adults. These experiences are the subconscious drivers of our behavior that
    we have never evaluated consciously. If we did, we would quickly discover these
    habits are not useful solutions to what confronts us as adults. The first key
    is to transform our relationship with discomfort: we must become aware of our
    thoughts about it and recognize our ability to work with them. This is the power
    of *metacognition*, or the practice of consciously viewing your own thinking.
    Through this process, we can actually set ourselves outside the situation in our
    minds and look at our thought processes to see exactly how we are thinking. The
    second key is to learn to recognize our thought processes without becoming overly
    absorbed in their drama and identified with their stories. Only then are we able
    to jump off the train of thought. When our attention is no longer hijacked by
    our thinking being stimulated by our physical and emotional discomfort, we start
    to have the freedom to turn it toward the goals and objects we wish to manifest.'

    And the reality is, when you are in survival mode or anxious or stressed, you
    are literally not thinking clearly and revert to habitual learned ways of behavior.
    Your body is flooded with cortisol, you are hypervigilant, your upper-level cognitive
    functions are diminished. Like Anula, we are overcome by physiological reactions
    that rob us of our natural brilliance, abilities, and intention. We lose our connection
    with the neocortex and its higher-level abilities of planning, reflection, insight,
    and even being compassionate. The presence of stress hormones gives cues to our
    cells to act out of self-preservation, essentially becoming more self-seeking,
    and thereby endorse our ego to become more self-seeking as well, diverting our
    attention to our immediate sensory experiences, instead of a broader, more holistic
    view of reality. The more you are in fear mode, the more your internal thoughts
    are clouded, and instead of seeing the world through a clear window, that window
    is opaque.

    has been hijacked by the survival response of the lizard brain. They become so
    used to this state of affairs that, on a day-to-day level, they come to identify
    completely with it. There is no distinction between their habitual negative emotional
    state and themselves. The feeling can be like being stuck on a train that is about
    to go over a cliff: although we know we are headed for disaster, we do not believe
    we have the power to jump off before it goes over the edge.'

    the train. Although it may sound counterintuitive or even foolish, the moment
    the train is about to go over the cliff is the moment when we most benefit from
    turning our awareness to our thoughts. With practice, we discover it is possible
    to view our own thinking objectively and without emotional attachment. When we
    set ourselves on the train platform rather than on the rushing train itself, we
    can watch the thoughts as they fly by. Seeing our thoughts for what they are is
    the first crack in the illusion of our helplessness. When we calm down enough
    to see them clearly, we make a startling discovery: there are gaps between the
    stimulus and our response. As we practice for longer, the gaps widen and we gain
    more and more agency in how we choose to act on our thoughts.'

    mind as rapid-fire, high-volume negativity, the most powerful place to cultivate
    the sense of inner power, and the most ready-to-hand, is in learning to detach
    emotionally from our thoughts. When we realize the tricks that evolution and our
    own physiology have created to make us do certain things or use shortcuts in how
    we think of things or respond to them, we become empowered to perform a kind of
    “manual override.” When we become aware of the tricks, and see them for what they

    And I am saying, “The truth is that your thoughts are influencing your reality.
    But you have more power over your thoughts than you think, and for that very reason,
    you have more influence over your reality.” I encourage you, when you take stock
    of your life and consider how to move forward, do not stop at negative external
    circumstances. Take the inner attitude into account. Do not take external environmental
    evidence as conclusive or some kind of prophecy of the only things to come. Every

    habitual negative rumination is highly uncomfortable. It can be excruciating and
    make us want to run for the hills, or regress to our old coping mechanisms. It
    is a monumental task that requires tremendous discipline and support. For those
    who are negatively affected by systemic oppression on a societal level, the task
    of liberating the mind from habitual fear can feel all the more like swimming
    against the current, because powerful and often violent forces of prejudice are
    mustered against their sense of individual sovereignty.

    by moment with much greater clarity and power, you can begin experimenting with
    thoughts that produce a good reality. You will begin to learn how, if you think
    and act in your old way, it produces one version of reality, and if you learn
    your lesson and choose otherwise, it produces another, more desirable one. The
    magic of the process is that it’s the same hardware. When you set your mind to
    a good result, the pathway is exactly the same, but the software is updated through
    positive neurofeedback. As the Stoic philosopher Epictetus said, it is not events
