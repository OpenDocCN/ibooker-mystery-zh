    Condé Nast shuttered in 2001, was a fashion magazine that also published a stellar
    list of writers. The magazine ran a famous college competition every year, and
    the winners came to New York to be guest editors for a month. Sylvia Plath wrote
    about her experience in *The Bell Jar.* Other winners over the years included
    Joan Didion, Ali MacGraw, Ann Beattie, Curtis Sittenfeld—and me.'
