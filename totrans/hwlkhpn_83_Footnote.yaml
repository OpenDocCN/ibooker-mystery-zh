    comment is often attributed to Napoleon, but the actual source is hard to pin
    down. I did find in his writings the comment that “war is composed of nothing
    but accidents. . . . There is but one favorable moment, the great art is to seize
    it.” I Iike that because it fits right in with what we’ve been saying about seeing
    opportunity and then making luck happen.'
