    journey from Hawaii to Tahiti, his teacher, the master Polynesian navigator Mau
    Piailug, asked him a question.

    cloud whose path predicted the weather.

    since the fourteenth century: a voyage from Hawaii to Tahiti in a double-hulled
    canoe called the *Hōkūleʻa* (Polynesian for the bright star Arcturus) without
    the use of Western navigational instruments. The trip had a deeply personal meaning
    for Thompson and his region: to prove that ancient Polynesians had made purposeful
    trips through the Pacific using sophisticated navigational methods based on the
    movements of nature, as opposed to passive drifting on currents or sailing from
    the Americas, as some Western doubters had posited. Mau was among the last living
    navigation experts in the ancient style from a people on the verge of cultural
    extinction, and Thompson’s training had been the fruition of a lifetime’s love
    for his island and its ocean.'

    inner compass, our inner image of where we want to go, the island arising in the
    distance of our own vision. This image fills us with inspiration, energizes us,
    and guides us through the inevitable ups and downs, opportunities and setbacks
    we will encounter on our own journey. If we choose a worthy destination, entrust
    our path to our inner vision, and hold to it even in the face of obstacles that
    appear insurmountable, through the doldrums where clouds obscure every familiar
    reference point in the sky, we will be led safely where we need to go by the compass

    the pursuit of fabulous wealth and outward success measured by society’s materialistic
    standards. This is a distortion of the manifesting process and its deeper potential.
    Sadly, the power of manifesting has been somewhat distorted by the false narrative
    of our culture, which promises that achieving material success will fill a sense
    of emotional emptiness. Sitting in my mansion with my head in my hands, I learned
    firsthand this was untrue. In fact, there is nothing about manifesting that is
    inherently about acquiring material possessions. In a sense, to envision and seek
    only material gain is to dream too small. I now find it ironic that when my twelve-year-old
    self imagined an island, it was to be private, all mine, its luxury a testament
    to my personal glory alone; when Nainoa Thompson imagined Tahiti, it held a deep
    symbolic meaning not only for himself but for his entire community and his lineage.
    Both of us imagined islands, but they were very different destinations.

    the right direction; it will be the basis for the intention we will consciously
    embed in our subconscious. Needs and desires have a way of evolving the more we
    experience. In the hierarchy of needs as posited by the psychologist Abraham Maslow,
    we must first meet our basic physical requirements for breath, clean water, food,
    clothing, and shelter. Only when these basic needs are met can we focus our effort
    and attention on others, on our need to connect, on those things beyond our basic
    survival such as the fact that others are suffering. That is our reality. The
    good news is that manifesting can serve you wherever you find yourself on the
    hierarchy of needs. Whatever it is you need, manifesting can work to help you
    find it.

    our inner compass set toward our intention. They also help us to free ourselves
    from the prison of old patterns created in our environment and prior actions.
    One of the most powerful ways to indicate the value of an intention to our subconscious
    is through associating it with a strong positive emotion experienced in the present.
    The more vividly we visualize our intention, the more emotionally heightened our
    inner experience will be. The more emotionally heightened the inner experience
    is, the more it has a chance to capture and hold our attention and alert the brain
    to give attention to it in the future.

    our sense of belonging, the strength of our bonds and connections with others,
    and life meaning, as well as our physiologic functioning and our immediate survival.
    A strong positive emotion signals to our subconscious that the intention is highly
    meaningful and deserves to be cultivated through our behavior. For this reason,
    when we practice visualization, it is essential that in addition to imagining
    the physical circumstances of achieving our goal or intention in detail, we tune
    in to our heart and experience the joy, celebration, contentment, and connection
    in our bodies in the here and now.'

    indicates to the brain to form a new neural circuit. Positive emotions increase
    the salience around an experience and teach the brain that experiences like these

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Philosophers, spiritual teachers, and scientists have identified two forms
    of well-being: hedonic and eudaimonic. Hedonic well-being, what we often call
    “happiness,” is transitory and characterized by attaining pleasure and avoiding
    pain, whereas eudaimonic well-being focuses more on meaning, realizing one’s potential,
    and contributing to one’s community, and, ultimately, is longer lasting. The debate
    over which of these two kinds of well-being makes for a truly happy life has raged
    for centuries. In ancient Greece, the philosopher Aristippus taught that the goal
    of life is to experience the maximum amount of pleasure, and that happiness is
    the totality of one’s moments of pleasure, while Aristotle argued that well-being
    is to be found in doing what is truly worth doing. Although these two kinds of
    happiness are related and often overlap, they can differ sharply and their differences
    have profound implications for our behavior, relationships, physical health, and
    our longevity.'

- en: In 2013, a group of psychologists surveyed almost four hundred adults, seeking
    correlations between their levels of happiness and meaning in many aspects of
    their lives, including behavior, emotions, personal relationships, health, stress
    levels, work lives, and creative pursuits. They found that although a happy life
    and a meaningful life are often linked, they don’t necessarily go together, and
    they used statistical analysis to separate out the two kinds of well-being. They
    discovered that meaning (separate from happiness) is not inherently tied to social
    benchmarks such as comfort and wealth, while happiness (separate from meaning)
    is. They also identified major differences between a life full of pleasure and
    a life full of meaning.

    reflecting on the evolving relationship between past, present, and future. As
    noted, happiness is usually experienced as transitory, while the satisfaction
    of meaning is longer lasting. Happiness from feeling good is often associated
    with self-centered “taking” behavior, while having a sense of meaning is often
    associated with selfless “giving” behavior. Where happiness depends on a sense
    of comfort, ease, or convenience, meaningful lives often include a surprising
    amount of challenging experiences and even stress, worry, and anxiety. And finally,
    expressing oneself creatively and caring about personal, cultural, and communal
    identity were linked to a life of meaning but not of happiness.

- en: Many people seek our materialistic culture’s image of “happiness” in the form
    of hedonic well-being or having all of our wants satisfied. In most cases, this
    pursuit fails to deliver the sense of a good life in the long term. While it is
    true that we must have our physical needs met before we are able to focus on seeking
    meaning and purpose, after a certain point, the satisfactions of physical pleasures
    drop off. Therefore, health, financial prosperity, and ease in life all ultimately
    increase hedonic well-being but not meaning. For most of us, only a life of eudaimonic
    satisfaction involved with meaning, purpose, and service to something we experience
    as larger than ourselves is the definition of true and sustained happiness.

- en: The differences between these two types of well-being are often written in our
    cells. In one study, researchers Barbara Fredrickson and Steven Cole examined
    the self-reported levels of happiness and meaning in eighty-four different participants.
    To measure the feeling of happiness, they asked questions like, “How often did
    you feel happy?” “How often did you feel satisfied?” “How often did you feel interested
    in life?” The more frequently participants reported these feelings of hedonic
    well-being, the higher they scored on happiness. To measure their sense of meaning,
    the researchers asked a series of questions examining their orientation toward
    something larger than themselves. They asked questions like “How often did you
    feel your life has a sense of direction to it?” “How often have you had experiences
    that challenge you to grow and become a better person?” and “How often did you
    feel you had something to contribute to society?”

    the researchers examined how certain genes expressed themselves in the participants’
    bodies. Cole, a genetics researcher, had previously identified specific gene expressions
    associated with various kinds of chronic adversity. Experiences of grief over
    a lost loved one, financial deprivation, loneliness, or military conflict cause
    the body to go into fight, flight, or freeze mode, the pattern of the nervous
    system that reflects threat, separation, and disconnection. When the body stays
    caught in the sense of threat, it triggers a gene pattern with two distinct features:
    the genes responsible for inflammation increase in activity, while the genes involved
    in antiviral responses decrease their functioning. In other words, when a body
    anticipates adversity and isolation, it prepares itself to face bacterial infections,
    while when it is doing well and feeling connected socially, it prepares to face
    viruses.'

    humans who suffered from loneliness and the ill effects of isolation were more
    likely to get bacterial infections from wounds. But when our ancestors were enmeshed
    in the social fabric of their tribe or band, they were more likely to contract
    viruses from prolonged contact with many different people. We continue to carry
    this genetic legacy and it turns out that it speaks directly to the debate on
    well-being.'

    discovery. It turned out that the people who reported high levels of happiness
    but little to no sense of meaning had the same genetic pattern expressed by people
    who are facing chronic adversity such as grief or loneliness. Their bodies, although
    frequently enjoying experiences of physical pleasure, were genetically disposed
    to inflammation. From an evolutionary point of view, pleasurable experiences without
    meaning, whether from alcohol, drugs, casual sex, or pressing “Buy” on an online
    shopping site, make the body feel like it’s been facing chronic adversity. Today,
    inflammation has been linked to serious health conditions such as heart disease
    and many cancers. And yet, 75 percent of the study participants reported feeling
    high in happiness and low on meaning, while only 25 percent reported “eudaimonic
    predominance,” the feeling that they had more meaning in their lives than happiness.

    the health benefits of a life of meaning are undeniable. Participants with a strong
    sense of purpose, even if they were not especially hedonically happy, showed a
    genetic expression associated with the deactivation of their stress response and
    inflammatory process. Rather than preparing for the bacterial infections faced
    by our ancestors left to tend their wounds alone, their immune systems had shifted
    to prepare to fight off the viruses that come from being in the middle of the
    pack and experiencing a wide variety of social connections. Their bodies could
    tell the difference. We can see in this phenomenon a genetic echo of heart rate
    variability: the heart that beats dynamically in response to a sense of connection
    with others produces a coherence that measurably improves physical and mental
    well-being, while the heart that feels disconnected beats rigidly to its own isolated
    rhythm, leading to poor cardiovascular and respiratory health and other illnesses.'

    change our situation, we are bound by subconscious habits of a mind rooted in
    fear. These negative beliefs about ourselves and our world limit the possibilities

    which desires we have access to and compel us to settle for crumbs or choices
