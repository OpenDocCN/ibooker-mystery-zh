    may have had someone like him, too. George was a Renaissance man: straight-A student,
    student council president, and three-sport letterman. He could make a buzzer-beating
    three-pointer from the corner baseline, hit a grand slam that made everyone in
    the stands rise to their feet and scream, and then turn around and orate an inarguable
    rebuttal on why the US Electoral College system should be abolished. Everywhere
    you looked, George was switching effortlessly between activities. Of course, I
    envied him and occasionally wished that just once I could watch him flop on his
    face like an ordinary and fallible human being, but mostly I admired the way he
    served the greater purpose of whatever team, student committee, or fundraiser

    homeostasis. On the African savanna where our ancestors evolved, some energy was
    spent foraging for food, but much of life was spent in downtime. Threats, when
    they arose, were often lightning fast; they were not chronic and ceaseless as
    in our modern world. Thus, the body was designed to quickly return to its resting

    how impulses are propagated along the nerves themselves: neurotransmitters. The
    term *neurotransmitter* is often used interchangeably with *hormones*, but the
    difference is that neurotransmitters are released from nerve endings in the junction
    between nerves, called the *synaptic cleft*, while hormones are released into
    the blood directly. There are over one hundred neurotransmitters in the brain
    that have evolved to regulate a variety of functions, most of which operate at
    an unconscious level, including heart rate and blood pressure, digestion and the
    sense of hunger and thirst, and our response to stress.'

- en: Four of these neurotransmitters are primarily responsible for our sense of happiness,
    well-being, and positive feelings and are, in fact, critical to our survival.
    These are dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin, and endorphins, which are colloquially
    called the “happy hormones.” Dopamine is often called the “reward chemical,” as
    it is associated with pleasure, satisfaction, and motivation, as well as learning
    and memory. It is also associated with the *flow state*, which is the experience
    of being so absorbed by an engaging, enjoyable task that your attention is completely
    held by it. Serotonin is often called the “mood stabilizer” and is associated
    with feelings of happiness, sleep regulation, sexual behavior, and appetite. It
    is also associated with improving one’s ability to learn and to improve one’s
    memory. A low level of serotonin is often associated with depression, anxiety,
    mania, and other mental disorders. Oxytocin is called the “love hormone” because
    it is associated with romantic attachment, bonding behavior, the sense of intimacy,
    recognition, connection, trust, and sexual arousal. Endorphins are the body’s
    natural painkillers and are released in response to pain or stress, creating a
    general feeling of well-being. Most people know endorphins from the so-called
    runner’s high of vigorous exercise, but they are also released by sex, meditation,
    chocolate, and laughter. As we will see in later chapters, these chemicals play
    an essential role in the experiences of positive emotion required to teach our
    brains to classify our intentions as important and worth pursuing.

  zh: 其中四种神经递质主要负责我们的幸福感、幸福和积极情绪，实际上对我们的生存至关重要。它们是多巴胺、血清素、催产素和内啡肽，通常被称为“快乐激素”。多巴胺常被称为“奖励化学物质”，因为它与愉悦、满足和动机相关，还与学习和记忆有关。它也与*心流状态*相关，即被一项引人入胜且愉快的任务完全吸引的体验。血清素常被称为“情绪稳定剂”，与幸福感、睡眠调节、性行为和食欲有关。它还与提高学习能力和改善记忆相关。低水平的血清素常常与抑郁、焦虑、躁狂和其他心理障碍相关。催产素被称为“爱情激素”，因为它与浪漫依附、联系行为、亲密感、认同、连接、信任和性唤起相关。内啡肽是身体的天然止痛药，在感受到疼痛或压力时释放，产生一种整体的幸福感。大多数人知道内啡肽来自剧烈运动时的“跑者高潮”，但它们也会在性、冥想、巧克力和笑声中释放。正如我们在后面的章节中将看到的，这些化学物质在体验积极情绪中起着至关重要的作用，这些情绪是教我们的脑子将我们的意图分类为重要和值得追求的。

    us to take the first-person perspective on that information. It is involved in
    mental time travel, from recalling past events to envisioning possible events
    in the future. And it plays a role in how we think about others: considering their
    thoughts, understanding and empathizing with their emotions, judging whether a
    behavior is right or wrong, and even perceiving a sense of isolation when we lack

    tasks involving mental concepts. An example would be an introspective meditation
    session when we focus our attention inward, exploring our thoughts, emotions,

    imagined experience of the future we envision. Second, when our mind wanders,
    it inevitably starts to elaborate on internal representations, and this is the
    foundation of our internal sense of self. While this sense of self is invaluable

- en: The salience network is the cognitive system the brain uses to determine what
    is important. As we will explore in much greater detail later, the brain is bombarded
    with somewhere between six and ten million bits of information per second, while
    being able to consciously process only fifty bits per second. This means that
    about 99.9995 percent of the stimuli reaching our brain are processed below the
    level of consciousness. Among the overwhelming barrage of internal and external
    stimuli we are encountering at any given moment, the SN identifies what is most
    relevant, or *subjectively salient*, and guides behavior accordingly. The SN is
    involved in detecting, filtering, and determining the relative priority of everything
    that comes at us from outside and inside, including perceived conflict and discrepancies
    in information. Our subconscious contains a classification of what we value and
    what we attend to automatically, and this influences how our SN scans for what
    is important in our experience. There is some evidence that dysfunction in the

  zh: 突显网络是大脑用来判断什么重要的认知系统。正如我们稍后将更详细探讨的，大脑每秒钟接收到大约六到一千万个信息位，但能够有意识地处理的仅为五十个位。这意味着大约99.9995%的刺激在到达我们大脑时，都是在无意识的层面上被处理的。在我们所遭遇的内部和外部刺激的压倒性轰炸中，SN识别出最相关或*主观显著*的信息，并据此指导行为。SN参与检测、过滤和确定所有来自内外的信息的相对优先级，包括感知到的冲突和信息中的不一致。我们的潜意识中包含对我们所重视和自动关注的事物的分类，这影响着我们的SN如何扫描我们体验中重要的内容。有一些证据表明，SN功能失调，例如当我们的注意力被强迫从有意识的方向转移到强迫性思维时，可能是焦虑、抑郁、疼痛和物质障碍的核心特征。
- en: Salience is usually related to context and is produced by novelty or the unexpected,
    but it can also be brought about by shifting one’s attention consciously toward
    whatever feature we choose to value. A salient feature can be thought of as the
    figure that stands out against the background of other non-salient features. Humans
    have a limited ability to process information; they cannot attend to every aspect
    of a situation. As we will see in greater detail later, the salience of a thought,
    idea, or intention determines which bits of information will most likely grab
    one’s attention and have the greatest influence on one’s perception of the world.
    When Anula was reading the letters she wrote congratulating herself, or visualizing
    herself helping her future patients and rehearsing the associated positive emotions,
    she was enlisting her SN to teach her brain that these experiences were important.
    Once that importance was established, her subconscious was primed to bring such
    experiences about in reality in order to get another hit of the same good feelings.
    Through repetition, we can make the intention we are attending to salient to the
    exclusion of other inputs. By doing so, we create what is known as *salience bias*
    or *cognitive ease*, causing our intention to be one our subconscious cannot ignore.

  zh: 突出性通常与背景相关，由新颖性或意外产生，但它也可以通过有意识地将注意力转向我们选择重视的特征而产生。一个显著的特征可以被视为在其他非显著特征的背景中突出的图形。人类处理信息的能力有限；他们无法关注情况的每一个方面。正如我们稍后将更详细地看到的，思想、想法或意图的突出性决定了哪些信息片段最有可能引起我们的注意，并对我们对世界的感知产生最大影响。当阿努拉在阅读她写给自己的祝贺信，或想象自己帮助未来的病人并排练相关的积极情绪时，她是在利用她的SN来告诉大脑这些经历是重要的。一旦这种重要性确立，她的潜意识就准备在现实中促成这些经历，以便再次获得相同的良好感觉。通过重复，我们可以使我们关注的意图突出，以排除其他输入。通过这样做，我们创造了被称为*突出性偏差*或*认知轻松*的现象，使我们的意图成为潜意识无法忽视的对象。
- en: Structurally, the SN includes the anterior (i.e., front) insula and adjacent
    inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), the dorsal (i.e., top) anterior cingulate gyrus
    (ACC), and the amygdala. The anterior insula scans from the bottom up for discrepancies
    in what we are perceiving, and then coordinates various brain regions together
    to marshal the resources necessary to respond when a discrepancy is detected.
    The dorsal ACC is involved in the appraisal of emotional states and conflicts,
    as well as the use of top-down processing to respond to perceived emotional discrepancies.
    Part of the ventrolateral posterior frontal cortex (PFC), the left IFG examines
    new information coming in and helps assimilate it into existing internal models
    by reappraising its meaning in relation to our preexisting network of associations.
    The amygdala is part of the SNS and is associated with identifying threats. When
    the amygdala is activated in a threat response, it negatively impacts the CEN
    and DMN. When everything is functioning properly, these structures work together
    to identify something as salient. However, when it is under the influence of the
    stress response, in the present moment or while recollecting a traumatic event,
    the SN may erroneously judge the importance of a particular internal or external
    event, triggering inappropriate autonomic or cognitive-behavioral responses.

  zh: 从结构上讲，SN包括前岛叶（即前部）和相邻的下额回（IFG），背侧（即顶部）前扣带回（ACC），以及杏仁体。前岛叶从下到上扫描我们所感知的差异，然后协调多个大脑区域共同调动必要的资源，以便在检测到差异时作出反应。背侧ACC参与情感状态和冲突的评估，以及利用自上而下的处理来回应感知到的情感差异。左侧IFG作为腹外侧后额皮层（PFC）的一部分，检查新信息，并通过重新评估其相对于我们已有联想网络的意义，帮助将其同化到现有内部模型中。杏仁体是SNS的一部分，与识别威胁相关。当杏仁体在威胁反应中被激活时，会对CEN和DMN产生负面影响。当一切正常运作时，这些结构共同识别某物为显著。然而，当它受到压力反应的影响，无论是在当下还是在回忆创伤事件时，SN可能会错误判断某一特定内外事件的重要性，从而触发不适当的自主或认知行为反应。

    our ability to activate the CEN. This in turn likely undermines the capacity for
    effective cognitive functioning and embedding of intention while decreasing our
    ability for emotion regulation. Thus, the embedding of one’s intention to manifest
    must be done in a safe and nonthreatening environment, resulting in maximization
    of one’s cognitive control. The more relaxed our bodies are, and the safer we

    materials of the physical world, are constantly resonating with each other. Resonance
    is a type of motion between two states, whether it be called vibration or oscillation,
    and it occurs at a wide range of frequencies. Thus, every part has a relationship
    with and is a part of a greater whole, which is again part of something greater.
    This is true of sentient beings but is also true within and amongst systems—whether

    and interconnected networks of biological structures and processes working coherently.
    Most people know what it feels like to be in this harmonious state, the place
    where our hearts, minds, and bodies are united in a feeling of wholeness or completeness.
    We referred to this earlier as “flow” or the “flow state.” The term *flow* was
    first described by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi in 1975 and has subsequently been widely
    referred to in a variety of fields beyond psychology. Terms such as “the zone”
    and “oneness” have also been used to describe this state. The concept, however,
    has existed for millennia under many other names. In such states, people typically
    feel connected not only to their deepest selves but to others, even to the earth
    itself. This state of internal and external connectedness is considered a coherent
    state of being. Coherence implies correlations, connectedness, consistency, and
    efficient energy utilization. Coherence is also used to describe the coupling
    and degree of synchronization between different oscillating systems. It can appear
    at one level of scale that a given system is operating autonomously, yet it is
    perfectly coordinated within the whole.

- en: On a local level, we can view the workings of the brain itself from the point
    of view of vibration. Various frequencies are detectable within the brain depending
    on the activity, with the most common being gamma, beta, alpha, theta, and delta.
    Gamma waves are the fastest wavelength brain waves and oscillate between 25 and
    100 Hz. They are associated with large-scale coordinated brain activities such
    as focus, attention, learning, problem-solving, and information processing. Beta
    waves, which oscillate between 12 and 30 Hz, occur during most conscious waking
    states and are associated with attentiveness, alertness, and concentration that
    requires maximum brain arousal. Alpha waves are those with a frequency of 8 to
    12 Hz and are associated with the brain in an idle state when not concentrating
    on anything in particular. Theta waves, with a frequency between 4 and 8 Hz, occur
    during light sleep, deep relaxation, and meditation, while delta waves, which
    are between 0.5 and 4 Hz, occur during deep states of dreamless sleep.

  zh: 在局部层面，我们可以从振动的角度观察大脑本身的工作。根据活动的不同，脑内可检测到各种频率，最常见的有伽马波、贝塔波、阿尔法波、θ波和δ波。伽马波是速度最快的脑波，振荡频率在25到100赫兹之间。它们与大规模的协调脑活动相关，如集中注意力、学习、解决问题和信息处理。贝塔波的振荡频率在12到30赫兹之间，通常出现在大多数清醒的意识状态中，和注意力、警觉性及需要最大脑部唤醒的专注性相关。阿尔法波的频率在8到12赫兹之间，与大脑在不集中注意力时的闲置状态相关。θ波的频率在4到8赫兹之间，通常出现在浅睡眠、深度放松和冥想期间，而δ波的频率在0.5到4赫兹之间，出现在无梦的深度睡眠状态中。
- en: Researchers such as the neurophysiologist Pascal Fries have explored ways in
    which patterns of synchronization among these frequencies in the brain produce
    different types of human consciousness. There are other theories that propose
    a resonance theory of consciousness that puts the concept of synchronized vibration
    at the heart of consciousness and even physical reality itself. Although the exact
    relationship between electrical brain waves and consciousness is still debated,
    the most important phenomenon of vibration for our purposes is what is known as
    *neural synchronization*. This occurs when the different frequencies harmonize
    with each other in terms of shared electrical oscillation rates, allowing for
    smooth communication between neurons, groups of neurons, and large-scale brain
    networks. Without this kind of synchronized coherence, inputs arrive at random
    phases of the neuron excitability cycle and are ineffective, or at least much
    less effective, in communication. When communication is fragmented or at cross-purposes,
    the brain cannot produce the synchronized coherence that allows for embedding
    of salient information into one’s subconscious.

    for information to be smoothly processed and perceived. Ultimately, we are aspiring

- en: Most people likely assume that the heart rate varies due to exercise or change
    in one’s emotional state, but don’t consider that the variability between each
    beat of the heart is an even more important marker of well-being. As an example,
    two people could have the same heart rate of sixty beats per minute, but their
    vibrational energy is completely different, with a vastly different effect on
    themselves and on others as well. The reason is that one person may have a heart
    rate of sixty with each beat being one second apart while another may vary between
    0.8 and 1.2 seconds. This phenomenon is called *heart rate variability*, or HRV,
    and has been studied extensively by a number of scientists, including Evgeny Vaschillo,
    Paul Lehrer, and Rollin McCraty. It may seem paradoxical, but when a person is
    stressed and anxious, their HRV decreases, meaning the heart beats more steadily
    and consistently. This is because the stress response stimulates their sympathetic
    nervous system, which in turn decreases vagal tone. The accompanying rigidity
    in the heart rate can result in a variety of associated negative mental and physiologic
    effects. In fact, there is a condition called *broken heart syndrome*, first reported
    in Japan, in which individuals have sudden cardiac death as a result of severe
    emotional trauma from a breakup or the death of a loved one.

  zh: 大多数人可能认为心率的变化是由于运动或情绪状态的改变，但却没有考虑到每一次心跳之间的变异性是一个更重要的健康指标。例如，两个人的心率可能都是每分钟六十次，但他们的振动能量却完全不同，对自己和他人的影响也大相径庭。原因在于，一个人的心率是每次心跳间隔一秒，而另一个人的心跳间隔则在0.8到1.2秒之间。这种现象被称为*心率变异性*，或HRV，已经被包括Evgeny
    Vaschillo、Paul Lehrer和Rollin McCraty在内的许多科学家广泛研究。听起来似乎有些矛盾，但当一个人感到压力和焦虑时，他们的HRV会下降，这意味着心跳变得更加稳定和一致。这是因为压力反应刺激了他们的交感神经系统，从而降低了迷走神经的张力。心率的伴随僵硬可能导致各种负面的心理和生理效应。事实上，有一种被称为*心碎综合症*的病症，最早在日本被报道，患者因分手或失去亲人而经历严重情感创伤，导致突发性心脏死亡。
- en: Conversely, when one is calm, thoughtful, relaxed, and caring, their HRV increases
    because they are stimulating their PNS by increasing vagal tone. It is when our
    PNS is stimulated that our physiology works at its best. This phenomenon results
    in the release of many of our happy hormones, such as oxytocin and serotonin.
    It also results in the lowering of one’s blood pressure, a decrease in one’s heart
    rate, and a decrease in the release of stress hormones and the production of inflammatory
    proteins. This phenomenon is a result of one’s heart rate being coherent, and
    it is this coherence that creates a measurable energy field that results in improvement
    not only in our mental and physical well-being but also in that of those around
    us. When groups of people who are generating this type of coherence come together,
    the effect becomes larger and more powerful.

  zh: 相反，当一个人平静、深思、放松并关怀时，他们的HRV会增加，因为他们通过提高迷走神经的张力来刺激副交感神经系统。当我们的副交感神经系统被刺激时，我们的生理状态就会达到最佳。这种现象导致许多快乐荷尔蒙的释放，例如催产素和血清素。它还会导致血压降低、心率减缓以及压力荷尔蒙和炎症蛋白的释放减少。这种现象源于心率的协调性，而正是这种协调性创造了一个可测量的能量场，进而改善了我们的心理和身体健康，以及周围人的健康。当生成这种协调性的群体聚集在一起时，效果会变得更大更强。
- en: It has also been demonstrated that the heart sends more information to the brain
    than the other way around. When the heart rhythm is coherent, there can be an
    impact on large-scale brain networks and there also tends to be an increase in
    heart-brain synchronization. And when heart rate variability increases, one sees
    an increase in activity and amplitude of brain waves. When Anula began opening
    her heart to her future patients, she was literally recalibrating the frequency
    produced by her heart, which in turn had a harmonizing effect on both her physiology
    and her interactions with others. As we will see later in this book, to harness
