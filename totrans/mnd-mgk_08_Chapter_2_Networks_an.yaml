    student council president, and three-sport letterman. He could make a buzzer-beating
    three-pointer from the corner baseline, hit a grand slam that made everyone in
    the stands rise to their feet and scream, and then turn around and orate an inarguable
    rebuttal on why the US Electoral College system should be abolished. Everywhere
    you looked, George was switching effortlessly between activities. Of course, I
    envied him and occasionally wished that just once I could watch him flop on his

    regions, and these regions scale into what are known as *large-scale brain networks*.

    of widespread brain regions that have been found using scanning techniques such
    as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the electroencephalogram (EEG),
    positron emission tomography (PET), and magnetoencephalography (MEG). Each network
    is identified by the role it plays in the overall production of cognition. The
    regions within a large-scale network display functional connectivity, which means
    they have been statistically correlated to light up together when the brain is
    performing certain high-level cognitive activities like processing an image or
    recalling a memory. Neurons may recombine in service of various mind functions
    depending on the situation, a bit like the best players in the NBA combining to
    form an all-star or Olympic team. The large-scale brain networks are the building
    blocks of a functioning brain, and disruptions in their activity have been implicated
    in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, Alzheimer’s disease,
    autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, ADHD, and bipolar disorder.

    the result of an ongoing civil war. As the years passed and the bombings intensified,
    her father worried about the direction the country was heading and began to think
    more and more about emigrating to the United States. Anula’s parents also felt
    that she and her brother would have better educational opportunities outside of
    Sri Lanka. The devastating tsunami in 2004 accelerated this process, and finally
    she and her family emigrated to the United States when Anula was fifteen.

    children a safer, more resource-accessible environment to thrive in, the family’s
    quality of life was drastically affected by the move in the short term. Her father,
    who had been a microbiologist working with infectious diseases in Sri Lanka, applied
    for countless jobs in his profession in America but could only work in a gas station
    and drive an Uber. Her mother, who had never been employed outside the home before,
    was also compelled to find work as a daycare provider to help support the family.
    As a result, they became financially unstable. Adding to the troubles, her mother
    was diagnosed with breast cancer. Without access to quality healthcare, the family
    was unable to receive treatment from good doctors and every medical bill was a
    new reason for dread.

    hormones like cortisol. Although she was raised in a country where Buddhism was
    widely practiced and exposed to meditation—she was even taught it in school—once

    way our nervous system functioning interacts with modern life at the most basic
    level.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Humans possess a bundle of nerves that originate in the brain stem, the vagus
    nerve, part of what is called the *autonomic nervous system* (ANS), meaning that
    it typically works automatically, beneath the level of consciousness. This part
    of the nervous system developed early in our evolution as a species and has two
    divisions. The first to evolve was the *sympathetic nervous system* (SNS), whose
    job it is to ensure our physical survival and the survival of our genes, and whose
    primary activity is to engage the *fight, flight, or freeze* response. This is
    where the amygdala reigns. The fight, flight, or freeze response of the SNS has
    existed in countless species for millions of years. Because it evolved to act
    in life-or-death situations, it moves along very short neurons and therefore has
    the power to completely commandeer our physical and emotional resources in a split
    second, filling our body with stress hormones like cortisol and tensing our muscles
    for action.
  prefs: []

    nervous system* (PNS), also known as the *rest-and-digest* response, whose job
    is to return the body to a peaceful resting state, a process known as *homeostasis*.
    The switch to rest-and-digest is accompanied by a wide variety of physiological
    changes to promote balance and harmony: our muscles relax, our heart rate and
    blood pressure decrease, and we produce more saliva for digestion. When we are
    in rest-and-digest, we feel calm and composed, we are open to connection with
    others and with our environment, and we have access to the higher-level functions
    of the neocortex, including abstract planning, creativity, and logical reasoning.'

    Frankl (although it’s only documented in the writings of self-help authors Stephen
    R. Covey and Wayne Dyer) that says, “Between stimulus and response there is a
    space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies
    our growth and our freedom.” It is our ability to choose that allows us to focus
    our attention and influence our unlocked subconscious to manifest our intention.'

- en: As Anula’s story of chronic anxiety illustrates, the fight, flight, or freeze
    response was never meant to be chronically activated. It was designed to produce
    a short-term physiological response to a stressful situation, say, encountering
    a rival tribe or outrunning a tiger, and then quickly return to its baseline of
    homeostasis. On the African savanna where our ancestors evolved, some energy was
    spent foraging for food, but much of life was spent in downtime. Threats, when
    they arose, were often lightning fast; they were not chronic and ceaseless as
    in our modern world. Thus, the body was designed to quickly return to its resting
    state where it could recover from the drama and release positive neurochemicals
    such as oxytocin and serotonin, which promote kindness and a sense of healthy
    connection. To be calm, contented, and caring is the baseline of our species.

    change, humans have profoundly changed our environment in only a few thousand
    years. In fact, we lived as hunter-gatherers in groups of fifty to a hundred until
    only six to eight thousand years ago. Unfortunately, today’s fast-paced and anxiety-provoking
    world is riddled with the sorts of uncertainties and frustrations that trigger
    the fight, flight, or freeze response and keep it chronically activated by unreal,
    imagined, or insignificant threats. Essentially, we are responding to a passive-aggressive
    comment in a colleague’s email through the same system that was designed to process
    a saber-toothed tiger attack. As we will see, the chronic activation of the fight,
    flight, or freeze response and its release of inflammatory proteins has damaging
    effects on the body, including an increase in heart disease and a weakened immune
    system. We pay a huge price in terms of health and longevity because of chronic
    stress.

    response is much more appropriate to flourishing in today’s world, it is engaged
    in a constant struggle for control over the body and mind.

    difference is that neurotransmitters are released from nerve endings in the junction
    between nerves, called the *synaptic cleft*, while hormones are released into
    the blood directly. There are over one hundred neurotransmitters in the brain

    sense of hunger and thirst, and our response to stress.'

- en: Four of these neurotransmitters are primarily responsible for our sense of happiness,
    well-being, and positive feelings and are, in fact, critical to our survival.
    These are dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin, and endorphins, which are colloquially
    called the “happy hormones.” Dopamine is often called the “reward chemical,” as
    it is associated with pleasure, satisfaction, and motivation, as well as learning
    and memory. It is also associated with the *flow state*, which is the experience
    of being so absorbed by an engaging, enjoyable task that your attention is completely
    held by it. Serotonin is often called the “mood stabilizer” and is associated
    with feelings of happiness, sleep regulation, sexual behavior, and appetite. It
    is also associated with improving one’s ability to learn and to improve one’s
    memory. A low level of serotonin is often associated with depression, anxiety,
    mania, and other mental disorders. Oxytocin is called the “love hormone” because
    it is associated with romantic attachment, bonding behavior, the sense of intimacy,
    recognition, connection, trust, and sexual arousal. Endorphins are the body’s
    natural painkillers and are released in response to pain or stress, creating a
    general feeling of well-being. Most people know endorphins from the so-called
    runner’s high of vigorous exercise, but they are also released by sex, meditation,
    chocolate, and laughter. As we will see in later chapters, these chemicals play
    an essential role in the experiences of positive emotion required to teach our
    brains to classify our intentions as important and worth pursuing.

    Anatomically, the DMN is also called the *medial frontoparietal network* (M-FPN)
    and is composed of the medial prefrontal cortex, the adjacent anterior cingulate
    cortex, the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus, and the angular gyrus.

- en: 'Essentially, the DMN is responsible for brain activity when a person is focused
    inward, including during wakeful rest, daydreaming, mind-wandering, and reminiscing.
    It allows us to carry out *self-referential processing*, or the ability to reflect
    on ourselves. In a sense, it is what lets us narrate the “story of oneself,” retrieving
    and integrating our autobiography stored in our long-term memory and enabling
    us to take the first-person perspective on that information. It is involved in
    mental time travel, from recalling past events to envisioning possible events
    in the future. And it plays a role in how we think about others: considering their
    thoughts, understanding and empathizing with their emotions, judging whether a
    behavior is right or wrong, and even perceiving a sense of isolation when we lack
    social interaction. In our ordinary lives, we experience the workings of the DMN
    mostly as the incessant chitter-chatter of the mind when it is not occupied with
    a specific task.'

    This label has since been discarded as misleading because the network is in fact
    active when we are pursuing *internally* goal-oriented tasks as well as cognitive
    tasks involving mental concepts. An example would be an introspective meditation
    session when we focus our attention inward, exploring our thoughts, emotions,
    and sensations without external distractions. When we are engaged in an external
    task, DMN can become the commentator that provides detailed thoughts on our performance.

    we call the “inner critic.” From a neuroscientific perspective, the inner critic
    can be seen as an unfortunate collaboration between the default mode network and
    the SNS. When the DMN gets hooked by the stress response of the SNS, we experience
    the sort of incapacitating self-consciousness that kept Anula paralyzed. Crucially
    for our purposes, the DMN is negatively correlated with the attention network
    (AN), meaning that the more it is activated, the less access we have to the power
    of our attention. The practices in this book are designed in part to diminish
    the overpowering sense of self-consciousness that the DMN contributes to our “inner
    critic.”

    such as mind-wandering illustrate that cognition is not always tethered to events
    in the here and now. As we practice, we will learn to intentionally detach our
    awareness from whatever is happening in our five senses and direct it toward an
    imagined experience of the future we envision. Second, when our mind wanders,
    it inevitably starts to elaborate on internal representations, and this is the
    foundation of our internal sense of self. While this sense of self is invaluable
    for all kinds of interactions and daily activities in life, it can gravely interfere
    with the flow state required to inhabit our vision fully, and so we must learn
    to turn down its volume.'

- en: The salience network is the cognitive system the brain uses to determine what
    is important. As we will explore in much greater detail later, the brain is bombarded
    with somewhere between six and ten million bits of information per second, while
    being able to consciously process only fifty bits per second. This means that
    about 99.9995 percent of the stimuli reaching our brain are processed below the
    level of consciousness. Among the overwhelming barrage of internal and external
    stimuli we are encountering at any given moment, the SN identifies what is most
    relevant, or *subjectively salient*, and guides behavior accordingly. The SN is
    involved in detecting, filtering, and determining the relative priority of everything
    that comes at us from outside and inside, including perceived conflict and discrepancies
    in information. Our subconscious contains a classification of what we value and
    what we attend to automatically, and this influences how our SN scans for what
    is important in our experience. There is some evidence that dysfunction in the
    SN, such as when our attention is forcibly wrenched away from our conscious direction
    by compulsive thoughts, may be a core feature of anxiety, depression, pain, and
    substance disorders.
  prefs: []

- en: Salience is usually related to context and is produced by novelty or the unexpected,
    but it can also be brought about by shifting one’s attention consciously toward
    whatever feature we choose to value. A salient feature can be thought of as the
    figure that stands out against the background of other non-salient features. Humans
    have a limited ability to process information; they cannot attend to every aspect
    of a situation. As we will see in greater detail later, the salience of a thought,
    idea, or intention determines which bits of information will most likely grab
    one’s attention and have the greatest influence on one’s perception of the world.
    When Anula was reading the letters she wrote congratulating herself, or visualizing
    herself helping her future patients and rehearsing the associated positive emotions,
    she was enlisting her SN to teach her brain that these experiences were important.
    Once that importance was established, her subconscious was primed to bring such
    experiences about in reality in order to get another hit of the same good feelings.
    Through repetition, we can make the intention we are attending to salient to the
    exclusion of other inputs. By doing so, we create what is known as *salience bias*
    or *cognitive ease*, causing our intention to be one our subconscious cannot ignore.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Structurally, the SN includes the anterior (i.e., front) insula and adjacent
    inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), the dorsal (i.e., top) anterior cingulate gyrus
    (ACC), and the amygdala. The anterior insula scans from the bottom up for discrepancies
    in what we are perceiving, and then coordinates various brain regions together
    to marshal the resources necessary to respond when a discrepancy is detected.
    The dorsal ACC is involved in the appraisal of emotional states and conflicts,
    as well as the use of top-down processing to respond to perceived emotional discrepancies.
    Part of the ventrolateral posterior frontal cortex (PFC), the left IFG examines
    new information coming in and helps assimilate it into existing internal models
    by reappraising its meaning in relation to our preexisting network of associations.
    The amygdala is part of the SNS and is associated with identifying threats. When
    the amygdala is activated in a threat response, it negatively impacts the CEN
    and DMN. When everything is functioning properly, these structures work together
    to identify something as salient. However, when it is under the influence of the
    stress response, in the present moment or while recollecting a traumatic event,
    the SN may erroneously judge the importance of a particular internal or external
    event, triggering inappropriate autonomic or cognitive-behavioral responses.

    in pursuit of goal-directed behavior. You can think of it as the CEO who gives
    orders and makes the calls regarding where the rest of the organization is heading.
    Whereas the DMN shows activation during resting awake states, the CEN shows activation
    during cognitively and emotionally challenging activities. Its major components
    include the dorsolateral PFC and the lateral posterior parietal cortex. The dorsolateral
    PFC manipulates material in working memory and weighs possible behavioral responses.
    The lateral posterior parietal cortex integrates information from the five senses
    as well as our internal perception to facilitate sustained attention. CEN hypoactivity
    is associated with depression and a variety of cognitive disorders.

    goals, and talk herself down from the state of chronic SNS activation. When it

    soothe the childlike nervous system and defuse its tantrum. This psychological

    the ceaselessly monologuing default mode network, dynamically allowing us to focus
    and direct our thinking at will without distraction or self-consciousness. The
    teamwork of the networks opens a pathway for us to embed our intention in our
    subconscious, which in turn causes significant resources in the brain to be devoted
    to bringing it about in reality.
  prefs: []

    that when under stress, the over-engaged SNS can hijack the default mode network
    such that our faculty for self-reflection, normally engaged in during safe situations
    and mediated by the DMN, becomes reactive. When this happens, our sense of being
    a separate and vulnerable self under threat produces too much rumination and blocks
    our ability to activate the CEN. This in turn likely undermines the capacity for
    effective cognitive functioning and embedding of intention while decreasing our
    ability for emotion regulation. Thus, the embedding of one’s intention to manifest
    must be done in a safe and nonthreatening environment, resulting in maximization
    of one’s cognitive control. The more relaxed our bodies are, and the safer we
    feel both internally and externally, the less interruption we get from the SNS
    and the less it prompts an overwhelming torrent of self-reflection from the DMN.

    12 Hz and are associated with the brain in an idle state when not concentrating
    on anything in particular. Theta waves, with a frequency between 4 and 8 Hz, occur
    during light sleep, deep relaxation, and meditation, while delta waves, which
    are between 0.5 and 4 Hz, occur during deep states of dreamless sleep.

    which patterns of synchronization among these frequencies in the brain produce
    different types of human consciousness. There are other theories that propose
    a resonance theory of consciousness that puts the concept of synchronized vibration
    at the heart of consciousness and even physical reality itself. Although the exact
    relationship between electrical brain waves and consciousness is still debated,
    the most important phenomenon of vibration for our purposes is what is known as
    *neural synchronization*. This occurs when the different frequencies harmonize
    with each other in terms of shared electrical oscillation rates, allowing for
    smooth communication between neurons, groups of neurons, and large-scale brain
    networks. Without this kind of synchronized coherence, inputs arrive at random
    phases of the neuron excitability cycle and are ineffective, or at least much
    less effective, in communication. When communication is fragmented or at cross-purposes,
    the brain cannot produce the synchronized coherence that allows for embedding
    of salient information into one’s subconscious.

    state of our physiological processes that determines the quality and stability
    of the feelings and emotions we experience. The feelings we label as “positive”
    reflect body states in which “the regulation of life processes become efficient,
    or even optimal, free-flowing and easy.” For the brain and nervous system to function,
    the neural activity, which encodes information, must be stable and coordinated
    and the various centers within the brain must be able to dynamically synchronize
    for information to be smoothly processed and perceived. Ultimately, we are aspiring
    to make our brain and nervous system vibrate in harmony with the world around
    us. As Anula puts it, “When you raise your energy by stepping out of the dark
    cloud, you align yourself with your destiny and things start manifesting.”

    by the heart. Many people do not realize that the largest electromagnetic field
    in the human body is found within the heart. The electrical field as measured
    in an electrocardiogram (ECG) is about sixty times greater in amplitude than the
    brain waves recorded in an electroencephalogram (EEG). The magnetic component
    of the heart’s field, which is around five thousand times stronger than that produced
    by the brain, is not impeded by tissues and can be measured from several feet
    away from the body. Not only that, but the electrical field also changes along
    with our emotions, so depending on how we are feeling, we are literally emitting
    a different quality of vibration from within our chest.

    in one’s emotional state, but don’t consider that the variability between each
    beat of the heart is an even more important marker of well-being. As an example,
    two people could have the same heart rate of sixty beats per minute, but their
    vibrational energy is completely different, with a vastly different effect on
    themselves and on others as well. The reason is that one person may have a heart
    rate of sixty with each beat being one second apart while another may vary between
    0.8 and 1.2 seconds. This phenomenon is called *heart rate variability*, or HRV,
    and has been studied extensively by a number of scientists, including Evgeny Vaschillo,
    Paul Lehrer, and Rollin McCraty. It may seem paradoxical, but when a person is
    stressed and anxious, their HRV decreases, meaning the heart beats more steadily
    and consistently. This is because the stress response stimulates their sympathetic
    nervous system, which in turn decreases vagal tone. The accompanying rigidity
    in the heart rate can result in a variety of associated negative mental and physiologic
    effects. In fact, there is a condition called *broken heart syndrome*, first reported
    in Japan, in which individuals have sudden cardiac death as a result of severe
    emotional trauma from a breakup or the death of a loved one.

    because they are stimulating their PNS by increasing vagal tone. It is when our
    PNS is stimulated that our physiology works at its best. This phenomenon results
    in the release of many of our happy hormones, such as oxytocin and serotonin.
    It also results in the lowering of one’s blood pressure, a decrease in one’s heart
    rate, and a decrease in the release of stress hormones and the production of inflammatory
    proteins. This phenomenon is a result of one’s heart rate being coherent, and
    it is this coherence that creates a measurable energy field that results in improvement
    not only in our mental and physical well-being but also in that of those around
    us. When groups of people who are generating this type of coherence come together,
    the effect becomes larger and more powerful.

    than the other way around. When the heart rhythm is coherent, there can be an
    impact on large-scale brain networks and there also tends to be an increase in
    heart-brain synchronization. And when heart rate variability increases, one sees
    an increase in activity and amplitude of brain waves. When Anula began opening
    her heart to her future patients, she was literally recalibrating the frequency
    produced by her heart, which in turn had a harmonizing effect on both her physiology
    and her interactions with others. As we will see later in this book, to harness
    the full potential of our inner power to manifest our intention, it is necessary
    to work not just with the brain but with the heart as well.

    to deploy our manifestation, we can begin taking the steps to enlist these systems
    and networks. The first step is understanding how to access our innate power to
    choose our response to a given situation. In particular, we must reclaim our power
    to place and hold our attention on whatever object we choose, rather than allow
    it to be hijacked by our evolutionary baggage: distraction, habit, and the tendency
    to focus on what frightens us. Learning how this power works and what gets in
    the way is the key to the entire process of manifesting the life we dream of—and
    making sure that dream does not become a nightmare. This is the first step I took
    toward rebuilding my life after it fell apart, and ultimately to creating the
    family I most deeply longed for.'
