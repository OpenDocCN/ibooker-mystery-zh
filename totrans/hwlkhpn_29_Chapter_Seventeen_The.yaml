    and I had spent investigating luck, I was feeling luckier. I had been encouraging
    myself to recognize opportunities, make thoughtful moves, and persist when others
    quit. I was exhilarated by the idea that you have more control over all aspects
    of your life than you sometimes realize. No matter who you are, luck isn’t a given—you
    have to make it happen for yourself.

    a lucky life.

    at me and laughed. “Quick answer, but unsatisfying, right?”

    see his brain ticking through various possibilities. I sipped iced tea. I waited.
    Finally I mentioned a couple of extremely wealthy people whom he had been hanging
    out with recently—flying on their planes, visiting their private islands, having
    meetings in their enormous townhouses. Barnaby knows a lot of billionaires, since
    he has advised many of them on how to make the greatest impact with their philanthropy.
    If you’re looking for people who’ve had a lucky life, they seemed a reasonable
    place to begin.

    Barnaby said, “but as individuals they struggle just like the rest of us.” He
    mentioned that one had gone through a couple of divorces and another was having
    difficulties with a grown child. “They’ve been very successful in some ways, but
    have they made a luckier life overall? I don’t really know.”

    a lucky person?” Some 67 percent of people said yes, and 33 percent said no. Barnaby
    and I wondered if specific factors made some people feel luckier than others.
    So he analyzed the data, looking for demographic differences, and he couldn’t
    find any. No matter where you lived, how much money you made, whether you were
    male or female, married or not, your chances of calling yourself a lucky person
    were about the same.'

    it be that what made you lucky was simply . . . thinking you are lucky? Your own
    attitude and optimism and sense of hope could ultimately define whether you had
    a lucky life.

    organized by a friend of my husband, a gregariously charming doctor named Michael
    Nochomovitz. The room was packed with interesting people, and toward the end of
    the evening, I met a scientist named Jonathan Stamler, who had flown in from Cleveland
    for the occasion. When I told him I was investigating luck, he immediately responded.

    luck played a real role in science. Not the random-chance kind of luck—a very
    different shade.

    that you’re lucky. Any discovery requires creativity and openness and a willingness
    to try the unexpected. You need a positive attitude and a belief that you can
    find something innovative. If you don’t *think* you’re lucky, you won’t *be* lucky.”

    for just about anyone. As if to prove it, a pretty young woman named Victoria

    she might have been easy to overlook.

    she spent her time traveling around the world tasting wine, and she oversaw the
    buying and selling of expensive bottles for the Michelin-starred restaurant where
    we were gathered.

    a lucky life spiral in many directions. She now has a boyfriend who makes an award-winning
    California rosé (from grapes grown in real soil).

    not mystical or preordained—it’s just that the more you believe you can make your
    own luck, the more you will do exactly that. You make a lucky life by believing
    that you deserve to be lucky.

    and he told me about Dr. George Vaillant, a psychiatrist and professor he knew
    who spent decades contemplating the ingredients for a good life. It wasn’t theoretical—Vaillant
    oversaw the famous Harvard study that tracked hundreds of men (yes, they were
    all men in those days) from the time they were college sophomores in 1938 until
    the end of their lives. One of the longest-running studies ever done, it looked
    at what made people happy and healthy.

    was a better predictor of health at age eighty than more obvious markers like
    cholesterol. The relationships didn’t have to be all hearts and flowers and Hallmark
    cards—after all, any romance has arguments and difficulties—but the definition
    of a good relationship turned out to be one where you could count on another person
    to be there for you. Relationships beyond romantic ones were important, too. An
    ability to make friends, talk to people, and get others on your side all contributed
    to long-term happiness and luck.
  prefs: []

- en: I went back and read some of the many papers and books Dr. Vaillant had written
    about the study. He had concluded that many of the things we would usually consider
    as luck makers in life—social class, parental success, religion—don’t make much
    difference. Above a certain level, intelligence doesn’t enter into the equation,
    nor does political ideology. (Though the most liberal men had the best sex lives.
    No explanation for why that would be.) What really mattered was positive emotions.
    Dr. Vaillant insisted that feelings like love, hope, and joy aren’t just nice—they
    are essential for a lucky life and the survival of our species.

    our beliefs shaping our luck and destiny has deep spiritual and philosophical
    roots. Barnaby’s career in philanthropy had given him the extraordinary opportunity
    to meet and travel with some important religious and social leaders, including
    Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama, Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, Pastor Rick Warren,
    and Archbishop Desmond Tutu. “What each of them told me in one way or another
    was that we all filter events through our own views—we have a template for how
    we perceive the world. And certain personal outlooks are going to yield more success
    than others.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can make luck on both personal and global levels by changing our thinking—that
    template we have in our head. So, for example, a hundred years ago, Mahatma Gandhi
    taught the value of countering oppression with nonviolent protest rather than
    violence. Gandhi believed that our outlooks and attitudes create the future that
    we make for ourselves and others.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “His belief was that your thoughts become your actions, your actions become
    your habits, and your habits become your destiny,” Barnaby said. “So there’s really
    a direct line from the beliefs you start with to the destiny you create for yourself.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I nodded. It was nice to hear him quote Gandhi, since a few months earlier I
    had done a project with Mahatma Gandhi’s grandson Arun Gandhi. Now in his eighties,
    Arun is devoted to spreading the messages of love and hope that he learned from
    his grandfather when he lived with him on his ashram as a teenager. Arun believes
    what his grandfather told him then, that you need to “be the change you wish to
    see in the world.” Whatever the circumstances you face, you make luck for yourself
    and others by living with hope and expectation. You choose the favorable future
    you want and then live as if it had already occurred.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    doesn’t mean that you have sunshine every day. But it does mean that you have
    a bigger perspective. Gandhi spent many of those days (and weeks and years) in
    jail, but he turned them to luck with the passion and conviction that he could
    shape a better future.

    things from happening by being wary and suspicious. “But avoiding bad luck isn’t
    enough in this world anymore,” he said. “You need optimism to create good luck

    if I’d like to meet Deepak Chopra, the spiritualist and New Age guru, whom he
    had recently gotten to know. Barnaby and I had talked about him earlier, and I
    was intrigued that Barnaby, the serious science guy, was so inspired by some of
    Chopra’s ideas. Now Barnaby explained that Chopra’s concept of a lucky life included
    discovering your own talents and giving yourself the freedom to find your own
    path. Chopra brought the New Agey platitudes about karma down to earth by saying
    that if you try to bring happiness and success to others, you are setting the
    stage for luck to flow back to you.

    Homebase. We waited in his cozy office, and Deepak arrived exactly on time, looking
    relaxed and surprisingly stylish in black pants and a black shirt with a red quilted
    Patagonia vest and red sneakers. His black eyeglasses were studded with rhinestones,
    and he had a silver bracelet on one arm and a red Fitbit on the other. He looked
    like the Elton John of gurus, but he was also perceptive and thoughtful and original.
    I liked him immediately. He was completely unruffled when we asked his view on
    what it meant in a grander sense to lead a lucky life. (It’s possible that when
    you’re Deepak Chopra, “What is the meaning of life?” is the kind of question you
    get asked every day.)

    often use “flow” to describe what happens when artists or musicians (or anyone
    else) get so fully involved in a creative process that time disappears and they
    become one with their work. Deepak saw it in an even more expansive sense—“when
    you are in the moment and spontaneous and you have no regrets, no anticipation,
    no sense of a self separated from what you are doing.”

    had written before that moods follow thoughts, and it doesn’t help to indulge
    your gloom. Once you are sunk in anxiety, it’s hard to lift yourself up. If you
    reinforce good moods, you have a better chance of creating flow, luck, and a sense

    wrong from the start and had left his huge home in suburban Maryland for a tiny

    quiet and vulnerable. Without the bustle of people and cars, the cityscape looked
    fragile, the bridges and buildings no sturdier than a child’s play set. I had
    been lucky to see the sun’s fireworks—lucky because I had looked. But I knew that
    random chance could change my day, too. A meteor could fall from the sky, the
    fragile bridge could fall, the lives we have all put so carefully together could
    be revealed to be built on sand and paste. There was nothing I could do about
    randomness other than to be prepared for it.

    life, but we can control more than we think. We choose our opportunities, our
    outlook, and our general life pathways. At the end of the day, what is life except
    the people we love and the experiences we share with them? We build a lucky life
    through the joy we find for ourselves and others. We learn to treat triumph and
    disaster the same and make luck from whatever is in front of us.

    the sunshine on the water, but I allowed myself to look up and appreciate it.
    We can all keep finding more of that sunshine. And every time we do, we are making
    our luck.
