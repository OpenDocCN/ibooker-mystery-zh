- en: On a bright Sunday afternoon, I drove upstate for a friend’s baby shower. The
    mom-to-be, pregnant with twins, was in her early forties, and the gifts arrayed
    in front of her weren’t a surprise since she had registered for them. At her casual
    wedding some years earlier, she had shown no interest in fine china or crystal.
    But now she wanted to be sure that her babies would be swathed in organic cotton
    clothes and silky-soft blankets, that they would have Mozart music to keep them
    stimulated and electronic swings to keep them calm. An elegant bassinet, cocoon-shaped
    crib, and luxury stroller that looked like it belonged at Kensington Palace had
    all been carefully selected to give the little ones a lucky start.

  zh: 在一个明媚的星期天下午，我开车前往州外参加朋友的婴儿送礼会。准妈妈怀着双胞胎，年约四十出头，眼前的礼物并不让人惊讶，因为她已经登记了这些礼品。几年前她举行的简朴婚礼上，根本没有表现出对精美瓷器或水晶的兴趣。但现在，她希望确保自己的宝宝们穿上有机棉衣物、用上丝般柔软的毛毯，听着莫扎特的音乐来激发他们的智慧，并用电子摇椅让他们保持平静。一个优雅的摇篮、一个茧形的婴儿床，还有一辆看起来像是属于肯辛顿宫的奢华婴儿车，都被精心挑选，确保这些小生命拥有一个幸运的开始。
- en: We all want to do everything possible for our kids—and that’s as it should be.
    But if luck occurs at the intersection of talent, hard work, and random chance,
    it wasn’t clear to me how posh stuff made lucky kids. It could be that the biggest
    gift we ultimately give our children is teaching them how to make their own luck.

  zh: 我们都想为我们的孩子做一切可能的事情——这应该是理所当然的。但如果运气是天赋、努力工作和随机机会的交汇点，那么我不明白奢华的物品如何能让孩子变得幸运。或许我们最终能给予孩子们最大的礼物，就是教会他们如何创造自己的好运。
- en: I was thinking about lucky kids early the next week as I wandered through the
    leafy campus of the Horace Mann School in the Bronx, New York. The kids here didn’t
    all start in cocoon-shaped cribs, but most had well-resourced parents who valued
    education and cared that their kids got the best. Those on financial aid had parents
    who had read to them and nurtured them into enrichment programs and made sacrifices
    to help them flourish. Parents with the right values certainly gave them a head
    start—but what ultimately made for a lucky life?

  zh: 进入下周一的早晨，当我漫步在纽约布朗克斯的霍雷斯·曼学校的绿树成荫的校园里时，我在思考着“幸运的孩子”。这里的孩子们并非都从茧形婴儿床开始人生，但大多数孩子的父母都拥有较为雄厚的资源，重视教育，并关心他们的孩子能够接受最好的教育。那些接受助学金的孩子，父母都曾为他们读书、送他们参加丰富的课外活动、并作出牺牲来帮助他们成长。拥有正确价值观的父母无疑给了他们人生的一个良好开端——但最终，是什么才造就了幸运的生活呢？
- en: Standing outside on a sunny sidewalk, I watched as a group of girls walked down
    a hill toward the athletic field. A security guard got discreetly out of his car
    as they crossed the street. At $45,000 a year, the school makes sure its kids
    are safe. But far more impressive than the guard was how the girls responded to
    him. Several waved as they walked by, and a couple called out, “Thank you, George!”
    He was a person, not an invisible presence. Being able to appreciate the people
    there to help them seemed like a good start on making luck.

  zh: 我站在阳光明媚的人行道上，看着一群女孩走下坡道朝运动场走去。一名保安悄悄地从车里走出来，看着她们过马路。年学费为$45,000的这所学校，确保孩子们的安全。但比保安更令人印象深刻的是女孩们对他的回应。几个人在走过时挥了挥手，有两个叫道：“谢谢你，George！”他是一个人，而不是一个看不见的存在。能够感激那些帮助她们的人，似乎是让好运开始的良好开端。
- en: Two girls in athletic shorts and Horace Mann T-shirts, lacrosse sticks tucked
    under their arms and long hair tied back to be practical, crossed the street.
    They were deeply engaged in conversation, and I wondered if they were talking
    about schoolwork or parties or the next lacrosse match. But my guesses weren’t
    even close. As they passed close to me, I heard one say earnestly to the other,
    “Are you happy? Because remember, that’s what really matters.”

- en: A few minutes later, I was in the light-filled office of Dr. Jessica Levenstein,
    head of the Horace Mann Upper Division. Dr. Levenstein started our conversation
    about lucky kids by telling me that the goal should always be a happy child. I
    smiled and told her the comment I’d heard from the lacrosse player. She nodded,
    obviously pleased. Her message was getting across.

  zh: 几分钟后，我来到了霍雷斯·曼中学上层部主任杰西卡·莱文斯坦博士充满阳光的办公室。莱文斯坦博士从讲述幸运孩子的故事开始，她告诉我，目标应该始终是让孩子快乐。我微笑着告诉她我从一位曲棍球运动员那里听到的那句话。她点了点头，显然很高兴。她的信息传达到了。
- en: But Dr. Levenstein has a different approach to happy kids than many administrators.
    With a PhD from Princeton and an expertise in Dante and Ovid, she’s not the type
    to post smiley faces around the school. She sees happiness as much more complex
    than posh stuff and positive slogans—and believes it comes at least in part from
    curiosity and intellectual discovery. In her view, the luck children need “is
    the ability to recognize all the various paths open to them that could potentially
    lead to happiness.”

  zh: 但莱文斯坦博士对快乐孩子的看法与许多行政人员不同。她毕业于普林斯顿大学，精通但丁和奥维德，她不是那种会在学校里张贴笑脸表情的人。她认为，快乐远比奢华的物品和积极的口号要复杂得多——并且相信它至少部分来源于好奇心和智力的发现。在她看来，孩子们所需要的幸运是“能够认识到所有可能带来幸福的不同路径”。
- en: Horace Mann regularly sends more seniors to Ivy League colleges than almost
    any other school in the country, but one of the great gifts Dr. Levenstein gives
    students is the ability to see beyond Princeton or Harvard and have a bigger view.
    When a sophomore approached her in a panic about an upcoming test, she tried to
    walk him through the thought experiment of what the impact would be of not doing
    as well as he’d hoped. Would he be disappointing his parents? Himself?

  zh: 霍雷斯·曼中学常常送更多的高年级学生进入常春藤联盟的大学，超过美国几乎所有其他学校，但莱文斯坦博士给予学生的其中一个伟大礼物，是让他们看到普林斯顿或哈佛之外的世界，拥有更广阔的视野。当一位大二学生慌张地走向她，担心即将到来的考试时，她试图带他进行一个思维实验，思考如果没有达到自己预期的成绩，会有什么影响。他会让父母失望吗？让自己失望吗？
- en: “Students often have the idea that there is one path to happiness, and if they
    veer off that path, the other alternative is misery,” she said. Ambitious parents
    may want the child to get good grades so he can get into Harvard and get a job
    on Wall Street. “That may absolutely be the key to your happy life, but at sixteen,
    you don’t know that yet. You also certainly don’t know the other kinds of happy
    lives that you’re not even considering. The challenge for all of us who work with
    students is to help expand their notions of what makes for happiness and a lucky
    life.”

  zh: “学生们常常认为，幸福只有一条道路，如果他们偏离这条道路，另一条选择就是痛苦，”她说。雄心勃勃的父母可能希望孩子成绩优秀，好让他进入哈佛大学，获得华尔街的工作。“这可能绝对是通向幸福生活的关键，但在十六岁时，你还不知道这一点。你当然也无法知道其他你甚至没有考虑过的幸福生活方式。我们所有与学生一起工作的人面临的挑战，是帮助他们拓宽对幸福和幸运生活的理解。”
- en: Dr. Levenstein sometimes invites back alums who’ve gone in original directions
    to talk to the students and show them that “there are possibilities that they
    can’t even envision at this stage that may involve jobs they’ve never heard of
    in cities they don’t know.”

- en: Encouraging students to think beyond Ivy League schools and Wall Street may
    sound like a high-class problem, but her point has a broader reach. Wherever they
    grow up, children often have a limited view of their possibilities. They see what
    their parents and friends are doing and little else. Maybe they can’t imagine
    leaving their small town or getting a job at NASA instead of at the local Walmart.
    Parents and teachers make kids lucky by showing them opportunities and expanding
    their view.

  zh: 鼓励学生超越常春藤联盟学校和华尔街的思维，可能听起来像是一个上层社会的问题，但她的观点却有更广泛的影响。不管孩子们在哪儿长大，他们通常对自己可能性有着有限的视野。他们只看到父母和朋友在做什么，别的几乎看不见。也许他们无法想象离开自己的小镇，或者去
    NASA 工作，而不是在当地的沃尔玛打工。父母和老师通过向孩子们展示机会并拓宽他们的视野，让孩子们变得幸运。
- en: So how do you do that? Dr. Levenstein thinks reading at home or in school can
    help. A work of fiction, she says, “can show children different ways to live.
    It gives them an understanding of the reality of other people’s existence.” The
    primary goal of an English class may be to teach students how to read and write
    at a sophisticated level, “but through works of fiction, we’re showing students
    models for human behavior.” I could think of a lot of books that set out to do
    that, but Dr. Levenstein surprised me by bringing up the Oedipus plays.

  zh: 那么，你该怎么做呢？Levenstein博士认为，在家或学校的阅读可以有所帮助。她说，一部小说，“可以展示孩子们不同的生活方式。它让他们理解其他人存在的现实。”英语课的主要目标可能是教学生如何在高水平上阅读和写作，“但通过小说作品，我们向学生展示了人类行为的范式。”我能想到很多书籍是以此为目标的，但Levenstein博士让我吃惊的是她提到了《俄狄浦斯》戏剧。
- en: “Students don’t identify with a child who is going to kill his father and sleep
    with his mother, but they do identify with a person who wants to make his own
    fate. They understand that idea of trying to wrest control of your own story,”
    she said, proving why she’s the educator and I’m not.

- en: I thought how inspiring it would be to go back to high school and spend some
    time in Dr. Levenstein’s class. Or pretty much any class at Horace Mann. And it
    wouldn’t be a bad idea, because parents who can model the openness and flexibility
    of mind she teaches make their kids luckier.

- en: Staying open to possibilities when your child’s lucky future is on the line
    isn’t easy. Even if you’re now trying to make luck for yourself by seeing different
    opportunities and zigging when others zag, you might be (unwittingly) doing the
    opposite with your kids. There’s a sense among parents that luck comes from control
    and a single path. Dr. Levenstein regularly fields calls from parents who want
    their child switched to a different teacher, often before the year has even begun.
    “They’ve decided there’s only one teacher who can be beneficial, and without that,
    the year will be a disaster,” she said. “If that’s where the parent is, I don’t
    see any happy way forward.”

  zh: 当你的孩子的幸运未来岌岌可危时，保持对可能性的开放并不容易。即便你现在正在通过看到不同的机会并走别人不走的路为自己创造运气，你可能（不自觉地）却在对孩子做相反的事情。家长们普遍认为运气来自控制和一条单一的道路。Levenstein博士经常接到家长的电话，他们希望把孩子换到不同的老师那里，通常是在学年开始之前就提出。她说：“他们已经决定，只有一位老师才能带来好处，否则这一年将是灾难。”
    “如果家长有这样的想法，我看不出有什么幸福的前景。”
- en: Whoops. I suspect we’ve all made a phone call like that. I did it when my younger
    son was going into fourth grade in the local public school. I’d heard from other
    moms on the sidelines at soccer practices that a teacher I’ll call Mrs. W was
    a horror to be avoided. She had ruined many a fourth-grade year. So when Matt
    got assigned Mrs. W, I called the principal. Like Dr. Levenstein, she wouldn’t
    change his class before it had even begun. She thought Matt and Mrs. W might be
    a good fit and encouraged me to give him a positive attitude about his teacher.

    scissors and a piece of paper to show him how to cut. “You may be a genius in
    math and reading, but you never learned kindergarten skills,” she told him. Fortunately,

- en: Children (and adults) learn to make luck happen when they are encouraged to

    their own luck if they see life as something that befalls them. “If your immediate
    response is to try to figure out who you can blame, then you’re always at the

    are on a much happier path,” Dr. Levenstein told me.
