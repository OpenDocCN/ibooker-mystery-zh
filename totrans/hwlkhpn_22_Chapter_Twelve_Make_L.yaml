- en: On a bright Sunday afternoon, I drove upstate for a friend’s baby shower. The
    mom-to-be, pregnant with twins, was in her early forties, and the gifts arrayed
    in front of her weren’t a surprise since she had registered for them. At her casual
    wedding some years earlier, she had shown no interest in fine china or crystal.
    But now she wanted to be sure that her babies would be swathed in organic cotton
    clothes and silky-soft blankets, that they would have Mozart music to keep them
    stimulated and electronic swings to keep them calm. An elegant bassinet, cocoon-shaped
    crib, and luxury stroller that looked like it belonged at Kensington Palace had
    all been carefully selected to give the little ones a lucky start.

    But if luck occurs at the intersection of talent, hard work, and random chance,
    it wasn’t clear to me how posh stuff made lucky kids. It could be that the biggest
    gift we ultimately give our children is teaching them how to make their own luck.

    leafy campus of the Horace Mann School in the Bronx, New York. The kids here didn’t
    all start in cocoon-shaped cribs, but most had well-resourced parents who valued
    education and cared that their kids got the best. Those on financial aid had parents
    who had read to them and nurtured them into enrichment programs and made sacrifices
    to help them flourish. Parents with the right values certainly gave them a head
    start—but what ultimately made for a lucky life?

    a hill toward the athletic field. A security guard got discreetly out of his car
    as they crossed the street. At $45,000 a year, the school makes sure its kids
    are safe. But far more impressive than the guard was how the girls responded to
    him. Several waved as they walked by, and a couple called out, “Thank you, George!”
    He was a person, not an invisible presence. Being able to appreciate the people
    there to help them seemed like a good start on making luck.

    under their arms and long hair tied back to be practical, crossed the street.
    They were deeply engaged in conversation, and I wondered if they were talking
    about schoolwork or parties or the next lacrosse match. But my guesses weren’t
    even close. As they passed close to me, I heard one say earnestly to the other,
    “Are you happy? Because remember, that’s what really matters.”

    head of the Horace Mann Upper Division. Dr. Levenstein started our conversation
    about lucky kids by telling me that the goal should always be a happy child. I
    smiled and told her the comment I’d heard from the lacrosse player. She nodded,
    obviously pleased. Her message was getting across.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But Dr. Levenstein has a different approach to happy kids than many administrators.
    With a PhD from Princeton and an expertise in Dante and Ovid, she’s not the type
    to post smiley faces around the school. She sees happiness as much more complex
    than posh stuff and positive slogans—and believes it comes at least in part from
    curiosity and intellectual discovery. In her view, the luck children need “is
    the ability to recognize all the various paths open to them that could potentially
    lead to happiness.”

    any other school in the country, but one of the great gifts Dr. Levenstein gives
    students is the ability to see beyond Princeton or Harvard and have a bigger view.
    When a sophomore approached her in a panic about an upcoming test, she tried to
    walk him through the thought experiment of what the impact would be of not doing
    as well as he’d hoped. Would he be disappointing his parents? Himself?

    veer off that path, the other alternative is misery,” she said. Ambitious parents
    may want the child to get good grades so he can get into Harvard and get a job
    on Wall Street. “That may absolutely be the key to your happy life, but at sixteen,
    you don’t know that yet. You also certainly don’t know the other kinds of happy
    lives that you’re not even considering. The challenge for all of us who work with
    students is to help expand their notions of what makes for happiness and a lucky
    life.”

    sound like a high-class problem, but her point has a broader reach. Wherever they
    grow up, children often have a limited view of their possibilities. They see what
    their parents and friends are doing and little else. Maybe they can’t imagine
    leaving their small town or getting a job at NASA instead of at the local Walmart.
    Parents and teachers make kids lucky by showing them opportunities and expanding
    their view.

    help. A work of fiction, she says, “can show children different ways to live.
    It gives them an understanding of the reality of other people’s existence.” The
    primary goal of an English class may be to teach students how to read and write
    at a sophisticated level, “but through works of fiction, we’re showing students
    models for human behavior.” I could think of a lot of books that set out to do
    that, but Dr. Levenstein surprised me by bringing up the Oedipus plays.

    isn’t easy. Even if you’re now trying to make luck for yourself by seeing different
    opportunities and zigging when others zag, you might be (unwittingly) doing the
    opposite with your kids. There’s a sense among parents that luck comes from control
    and a single path. Dr. Levenstein regularly fields calls from parents who want
    their child switched to a different teacher, often before the year has even begun.
    “They’ve decided there’s only one teacher who can be beneficial, and without that,
    the year will be a disaster,” she said. “If that’s where the parent is, I don’t
    see any happy way forward.”

    son was going into fourth grade in the local public school. I’d heard from other
    moms on the sidelines at soccer practices that a teacher I’ll call Mrs. W was
    a horror to be avoided. She had ruined many a fourth-grade year. So when Matt
    got assigned Mrs. W, I called the principal. Like Dr. Levenstein, she wouldn’t
    change his class before it had even begun. She thought Matt and Mrs. W might be
    a good fit and encouraged me to give him a positive attitude about his teacher.

    scissors and a piece of paper to show him how to cut. “You may be a genius in

    their own luck if they see life as something that befalls them. “If your immediate
    response is to try to figure out who you can blame, then you’re always at the
    mercy of outside forces. People who see their lives as driven by their own actions
    are on a much happier path,” Dr. Levenstein told me.

    or order up an ice-cream cake when your seventh-grader wins a science award. Hey,

    the book in part because she realized that what worked so well with her older
    daughter hit some bumps with the different (and more rebellious) personality of
    her younger child. But both girls landed at Harvard and remember their childhoods
    happily. Her older daughter, Sophia, appreciates that her parents were always
    on her side, and their high expectations told her “they had the confidence that
    I could do amazing things.”

    is now glad that her mom didn’t give up on her. “If I did poorly in a test, she
    did not let me lie in bed and wallow. She’d tell me I needed to get up and study
    to get a better mark so I would feel better,” she said.

    ideas about making lucky kids, I was starting to see how much they had in common.
    Levenstein wanted the students at Horace Mann to see many paths to happiness,
    and Chua prescribed a single path for her own daughters. But Lulu’s comment struck
    me because at the end of the day, she had learned not to blame anyone, to take
    responsibility, and to make her own luck (and good grades). Levenstein would surely
    approve of that.

    are happy kids within each level of ability. Professor Chua had been less sure
    of that with her daughters—she thought success would make them happy. But now
    she was more aware that it was the process—the trying, the risk-taking, the believing
    in yourself—that makes you lucky.

    back, I’m almost on the other side now. I think our children are overscripted,
    overcontrolled now. I can see how anxious their parents are, and I think we’ve
    taken a wrong turn somewhere. The goal is to make children strong in themselves.”

    that the strength and luck come when children “put the work in, have some control,
    and demonstrate to themselves that through their own volition they can accomplish
    something.” We all want confident kids—but telling them how great they are doesn’t
    really do much. They need to see how they can make luck happen themselves.

    could see herself as very lucky or very unlucky. “And I totally see myself as
    one of the luckiest people you know,” she said brightly. That positive attitude
    is a key element in making more luck. “People like positive people, so projecting
    optimism and confidence and upbeatness as opposed to negativity is actually part
    of success,” she said.

    with phrases the students had contributed about what made for a healthy life.
    I had written them down, and I pulled out my notebook now and looked at the lines.
    They included:'

    on a lucky life. Given the school they attended, they worked hard, which would
    lead to the cycle of confidence building and luck making that Amy Chua envisioned.
    But they were also being encouraged to have that positive, inquisitive spirit.
    Lucky kids understand that if they look for the good, they’re likely to find it.
