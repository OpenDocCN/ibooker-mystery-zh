    out the window as we passed Edison, New Jersey. The connection to the great inventor
    Thomas Edison—the guy who said that genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent
    perspiration—got Barnaby thinking.

    He is convinced that if he wants something fervently enough, he will get it. He’s
    not spoiled—he’s just persistent. And his focus and intensity have made him seem
    very lucky. For example, when he was just seventeen, he decided he wanted to study
    with the great evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr at Harvard—and he was going to
    make it happen no matter what.[*](45_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1) He flew in from
    Alaska and showed up at Mayr’s office. His passion was so convincing that Mayr
    invited him to stay—and Barnaby may be the only person who ever studied at Harvard
    without SATs, grade transcripts, or teacher evaluations.[*](46_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_2)

    translates to luck. Were the hardest-working people really the luckiest?

    and New Age guru. As a scientist, Barnaby had initially been a little wary of
    meeting him because Chopra’s ideas on alternative medicine have been attacked
    by many mainstream scientists. But as he got to know Chopra over several months,
    Barnaby was won over by Chopra’s openness toward a bigger picture of reality and
    his insights into how we can exert control over our own lives. Through his inspirational
    talks, Chopra shares the idea that we can make things happen for ourselves by
    our own thoughts and attitudes.

    come with being passionate make positive things happen. Putting your desire out
    to the universe just means that you know what you want. Once you’ve declared it

    or New Agey at all. You don’t get more respected and mainstream than Nobel Prize
    winner Daniel Kahneman, and some of his research suggested that simply *wanting*
    can change your luck for *getting*. So, for example, in analyzing one study, he
    found that people who said when they were eighteen years old that being very well-off
    financially was important to them ended up wealthier twenty years later than others.

    over twenty years, beginning when they were just starting at elite universities.
    The initial questionnaire had students use a four-point scale to rank how much
    they cared about money. On the follow-up twenty years later, Kahneman looked at
    one group and discovered that for every extra point they had given on the money-importance
    scale, they were making an additional $14,000 in income—the equivalent of more
    than $22,100 today.

    than a three on the want-to-be-rich scale results in a luck bonus that’s enough
    to buy a new Honda every year. Most of us wouldn’t mind that kind of lucky input
    to our own bank accounts. And we can all make that kind of luck. If you’ve told
    yourself at age eighteen (or any other age) that having money is a top goal, you’re
    going to set yourself on a course (consciously or unconsciously) to make that
    happen. You’ll put in serious effort, get to know the right people, and land an
    entry-level job when you graduate that allows you to rent your own apartment.
    Your parents’ friends (whose children are all back living at home) will wonder
    how you got so lucky. You can tell them that in order to find a pot of gold, you
    need to identify it. Only then can you can follow the right rainbow.

    any one of those options as a four-out-of-four in desirability would be more likely
    to achieve it than those not as driven. Once you’ve acknowledged to yourself what
    you consider a lucky life, you start putting into place all the pieces to get

    In his own books, he has pointed out that randomness plays a bigger role in some
    successes than we like to admit. A lot of things we find miraculous (“I was walking
    down the street and ran into an old college friend!”) are examples of simple statistical
    chance. But I was interested in whether a guy who studied randomness thought we
    could affect our own luck.'

    what your skill,” he said.

    percent of the time and one who succeeds only 1 percent of the time. Sometimes
    the less talented person can seem to be incredibly lucky at landing a great job
    or acting part or loving spouse. But there’s a good chance that he’s changed his
    odds by not giving up and so having more at bats. “If you try a hundred times,
    you might very well succeed, because then statistics are on your side,” Mlodinow
    said. “It’s how you turn a 1 percent person into a 99 percent person.” In other
    words, the less obviously talented person who tries a hundred times can have the
    same success as the superstar who tries only once.

    can’t control everything and are sometimes caught in swirls of history much bigger
    than ourselves. He also recognizes the power of randomness in daily life and admits
    that he likes to trace back the instances that made a difference—and how they
    occurred. We can all do that. If you left your office a moment earlier, you might
    have been hit by the drunk driver rather than watching the accident happen to
    the guy in front of you. Or if you hadn’t sat a little longer to have an extra
    cup of coffee, you wouldn’t have met the person who became your best friend. Physicists

    atoms around us.

    dust particles in a sunbeam streaking into a building and realizing that “their
    dancing is an actual indication of underlying movements of matter that are hidden
    from our sight.” Albert Einstein and others later brought some mathematical precision
    to the mystery, making the causes of the dancing less hidden. In real life, we
    may be tossed in Brownian motion, but that’s not the end of the story. As Mlodinow
    put it, “What really matters in your life is how you react to the opportunities
    and challenges that randomness brings your way.”

    head into the field, the more opportunities you’ll find. One of the best ways

    that successful people are the ones who don’t give up brings science and real
    life together.

    could have been any other outcome. You look at what happened and take it as proof
    that it *had* to happen. But it didn’t. Writer John Grisham has sold more than
    275 million books worldwide, but his first legal thriller was turned down by twenty-eight
    publishers before one small house finally said yes. Beloved Dr. Seuss (Theodor
    Geisel) had a similar number of rejections. He planned to burn the manuscript
    of *And* *to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street* when a chance meeting with
    a college classmate convinced him to give it one more try. He has sold over 600
    million books, and even these many years after his death, he remains the number
    one bestselling children’s author in America. And J. K. Rowling had twelve rejections
    of her first Harry Potter book before a London publisher gave her a meager advance
    of £1500 and did an initial print run of an even more anemic 1,000 copies. Now
    that the Harry Potter books have sold 450 million copies and been made into movies
    that earned some $6 billion, it’s easy to imagine that the world was simply begging
    for Harry. But what would have happened if Rowling (or her agent) had decided
    that a dozen rejections was enough?

    easier to count). Just about everybody has to decide consciously or not how many
    times they’re willing to put themselves on the line. Pushing forward with passion
    is how you get lucky, but it’s also how you get disappointed. Teenagers assiduously
    court an attitude of being cool as a way of proving that they don’t really care
    what happens. If you’re too cool for school, you don’t have to worry about getting
    As. If you’re too cool for the prom, you don’t have to care about getting invited.

    success in life. You get lucky when you admit what you want and go after it.

    miracle. One company uses what it calls “neural networks” to analyze scripts with
    more than a hundred different components to determine if the resulting movie will
    be a box-office success. Back in 2004, a guy named Ryan Kavanaugh started Relativity
    Media on what he called a “Monte Carlo model”—a risk-assessment algorithm (borrowed

    of increasing returns, which has quickly become a paradigm-changing explanation
    for breakaway success in high-tech companies. He has shown that a product that

    of the people who have all the luck, you need to nurture both persistence and
    passion. Those are the great luck-making personality traits, and you don’t have
    to be born with them. Urging young people to follow their passions is a regular
    theme of commencement addresses, but the message leaves a lot of new graduates
    despondent. They don’t yet have a passion, so they wait for the epiphany that
    will give them one fully formed. But that’s just not the way it happens. In her
    book *Grit*, psychologist Angela Duckworth points out that passion for your work
    “is a little bit of *discovery*, followed by a lot of *development*, and then
    a lifetime of *deepening*.” Those commencement speakers would be better off advising
    that you explore for a while until you find what you care about. Then nurture
    your interest and decide that you will stick with your approach. At that point,
    your persistence has the power to bring cascades of luck tumbling in your direction.

    family where curiosity, humor, and intellect were all part of the mix. “The home
    environment is the primordial soup from which personality emerges,” he said. His
    mother was an early believer in finding a passion and pursuing it to create a
    lucky life. “She used to say, ‘You can be whatever you want as long as you’re
    happy. You can be a garbageman as long as you’re the best one.’ I told her, ‘I’m
    sloppy, so it will be hard to be number one at that.’”

    be (at least) 90 percent rejected, since “only about one in ten cartoons ever
    works.” Persistence eventually starts to look like luck. One of his own cartoons
    became wildly popular and among the most reprinted in the magazine’s history.

    week from his extensive bench of younger cartoonists as well as unsolicited ideas
