    Uber cars or doing chores for TaskRabbit as they wait for the lucky break that
    will catapult them to stardom. Many majored in drama in college or starred in
    a hometown production of *Rent*—and now they need someone else to notice their
    talent, too.

    redhead I met one warm evening at a café on Sunset Boulevard. She was behind the
    bar, making her signature Moscow mule—vodka, lime, and ginger beer. (I ordered
    a Diet Coke.) But making the perfect drink wasn’t what kept Cassie going. As we
    chatted, she told me she had recently graduated from college and had driven her
    beat-up Kia two thousand miles west to come to Hollywood. Now she was waiting
    for the lucky encounter that would make her a star.

- en: Ah, yes, lucky Harrison. His early adventures are as legendary among acting
    aspirants as the exploits of Indiana Jones. When he first arrived in Los Angeles
    in the 1960s, Ford got so little attention for his acting prowess that he started
    working as a carpenter. A young director who was also starting out hired him to
    build some cabinets for his house. They got to know and like each other, and the
    director gave Ford a part in a small movie he was shooting on a minimal budget.
    It was turned down by six movie studios but eventually became an unexpectedly
    massive hit.

    heard of him? A few years later, Lucas got the go-ahead to make another movie
    the studios didn’t really believe in—*Star Wars*—and he cast his new buddy Harrison
    Ford in it.

    Channel) who would spot her potential.

    that made him one of the biggest stars of his generation. If not for those cabinets,
    he might never have rocketed to international fame in *Star Wars*. A different
    actor would have been frozen in a large block of carbonite as the very cool Han
    Solo.

- en: The idea that chance events can play such a huge role in a career is both encouraging
    (“It can happen to me!”) and discouraging (“But what if it doesn’t?”). Many people
    in Hollywood and elsewhere believe you make your own luck, which explains the
    would-be screenwriters who have their scripts with them at all times, ready to
    present to anyone with a friendly face.

    I realized that it was possible I would see her on the big screen someday. But
    more than a single chance encounter would be at play. In moving to Hollywood,
    working at the bar, and talking to people (like me), she was creating her own
    opportunities. She had put all the pieces in place to make her own luck.

- en: We chatted a little more until a friend of mine arrived, and Cassie discovered
    that I had once been a TV producer with a fun and interesting career. At the end

- en: What can any of us—including Cassie—do to make ourselves one of the lucky ones?
    Sure, random chance plays a role in life, but we can’t just shrug our shoulders
    and leave it at that. We have to take the right steps and control what we can.

  zh: 我们每个人，包括凯西，能做些什么才能成为幸运儿呢？当然，随机机会在生活中扮演着角色，但我们不能仅仅耸耸肩就算了。我们必须采取正确的步骤，控制自己能控制的部分。
- en: I thought of the poem by Emily Dickinson in which she wrote that luck isn’t
    chance, it’s hard work, and “Fortune’s expensive smile / is earned—” I’ve always
    liked that phrase, and now, as I walked to my car in the warm Los Angeles night,
    I wondered what it takes to win fortune’s expensive smile. How do we go about
    making our own luck?

    afternoon tea with my friend Barnaby Marsh. Having gone to Oxford as a Rhodes
    Scholar, Barnaby still likes strong tea and scones, and I’m always happy to join
    him. Barnaby is in his early forties, with a quirky, original way of thinking,
    and he holds appointments at both the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton
    and the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard. In other words, he’s the
    kind of guy you turn to when you’re trying to figure something out.

    can take some of the onus off its all being random chance.”

    for creating luck might be. Talent was surely one of them. So was hard work.

    realize that it’s there for the taking. There’s enough luck in the world for everyone
    if you know where to look.”

- en: So why do we so often miss it? Barnaby turned briefly scientific on me and pointed
    out that, biologically, the human attention span was set to screen out things
    that weren’t necessary for survival. Now we needed to turn that instinct on its
    head and learn to screen things *in.*

  zh: 那么，为什么我们常常错过它呢？Barnaby简短地变得科学了一下，指出生物学上，人类的注意力范围是设定来筛选掉那些对生存无关紧要的事物的。现在，我们需要颠倒这一本能，学会筛选进那些重要的事物，*而不是排除它们。*

- en: Barnaby was convinced that whether you’re Harrison Ford looking to be an actor,
    a millennial wanting to find true love, or a corporate executive plotting to be
    CEO, you have more control over the events in your life than you realize. We often
    don’t recognize how many things we set in motion by our own actions. Sometimes
    the seed of opportunity that we plant doesn’t blossom into luck until weeks or
    months or even years later. When it does, it looks to everyone else like random
    chance—but we’ve made it happen. Call it planned serendipity.

  zh: Barnaby坚信，无论你是想成为演员的哈里森·福特，还是想找到真爱的千禧一代，或者是图谋成为CEO的企业高管，你对自己生活中的事件有比你想象的更多的控制力。我们常常没有意识到，很多事情是我们通过自己的行动推动的。有时我们播下的机会种子，直到几周、几个月甚至几年后才会开花结果。当它出现时，看起来像是偶然的机会——但其实是我们让它发生的。可以称之为“计划中的偶然”。
- en: Barnaby told me that his research at Oxford had been on risk-taking, and he
    was working on theoretical concepts of luck at the Institute for Advanced Study.
