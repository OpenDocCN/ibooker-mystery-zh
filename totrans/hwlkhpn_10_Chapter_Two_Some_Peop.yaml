    about luck. A surprisingly small percentage thought it was totally random, as
    our national survey showed. Some 67 percent of respondents said that working hard
    had contributed to lucky outcomes in their own life, and 64 percent said they
    got lucky by being curious and seeking new opportunities.

- en: Recognizing the nuances of making luck can be complicated. For millennia, philosophers
    and theologians have danced around discussions of luck. Back in 293 BC, the Romans
    dedicated one of the first temples (many more would follow) to Fortuna, the goddess
    of fortune and luck. She was widely worshipped for the bounty she could potentially
    distribute and the prosperity she might offer. Medieval artists portrayed the
    capriciousness of the fate she doled out by having her stand on a ball or next
    to a wheel of fortune. When the Roman poet Ovid was sent into exile, he glumly
    pointed out that Fortuna “admits by her unsteady wheel her own fickleness; she
    always has its apex beneath her swaying foot.” Ah, the fickle foot of fate. The
    equivalent Greek deity was Tyche, who was sometimes depicted in a blindfold. If
    the goddess who controls your destiny is blind, you’re not so surprised when unexpected
    things happen.

    Fortuna to Vanna White, who flips the letters on the endlessly popular TV show
    *Wheel of Fortune*. It is the longest-running syndicated game show ever and has
    been on the air in one form or another since 1975\. On the TV show, you start
    with an element of random luck—spinning a real-life wheel with twenty-four slots
    to determine how much money you are playing for, maybe $300 or $1,000\. You can
    also land on a slot where you lose everything—which means Ovid was right about
    the fickleness of fate.

    begins. To actually win, you have to put in some effort, fill in the blanks, and
    have the skill to guess the answer before your competitor figures it out. That
    combination of chance, talent, and hard work is a pretty good definition of what
    creates good fortune—whether on a TV show or in everyday life. With apologies
    to the admirable Fortuna, Vanna and her game may offer a better example of what
    modern luck is really all about—since it puts you solidly at the intersection
    of hard work, talent, and chance.

    softball. It was a low-key game, and when one of the little girls got tired of
    standing in the outfield, she shouted that she was going to look for four-leaf
    clovers. Several others quickly followed. After a while, most of the seekers gave
    up—they drifted back to the game or did some lackadaisical cartwheels. But one
    little girl in a yellow T-shirt and cutoffs (I’ll call her Sunny) kept going in
    her search and finally jumped up in excitement. She’d found it! She ran back to
    her friends to show off her good luck charm.

  zh: 几天后，我去了一家本地公园，看我认识的一个七岁小孩打垒球。这是一场低调的比赛，当其中一个小女孩站在外场站累了时，她喊道要去找四叶草。其他几个孩子很快跟了上来。过了一会儿，大部分寻找者都放弃了——他们又回到比赛中或者懒散地做些翻滚动作。但是，一个穿着黄色T恤和短裤的小女孩（我称她为Sunny）一直坚持寻找，最后兴奋地跳了起来。她找到了！她跑回去向她的朋友炫耀她的幸运草。

- en: Yes, Sunny was lucky—but not in any mystical way. She’d had the persistence
    to keep looking after the others gave up and an ability to spot patterns or differences
    that most would have missed. She didn’t mind lots of disappointments and had the
    resilience to keep going. Since three-leaf clovers are more common than four-leaf
    clovers by almost ten thousand to one, she’d had to face a lot of failures before
    finding the winner. But she liked the challenge and always expected to find what
    she wanted—and she probably had fun looking, too.

  zh: 是的，Sunny确实很幸运——但这并不是因为某种神秘的原因。她有足够的坚持力，在其他人放弃后仍然继续寻找，而且她有发现别人容易忽略的模式或差异的能力。她不怕失望，并且有足够的韧性坚持下去。由于三叶草比四叶草更常见，几乎是万分之一的比例，她在找到幸运草之前不得不面对许多失败。但她喜欢这个挑战，并且总是期待能找到她想要的东西——而且她可能也很享受寻找的过程。
- en: The little friend who announced that Sunny would go from lucky to luckier was
    probably right (and not because Sunny now has a four-leaf clover). The qualities
    that let Sunny find that four-leafer in the first place—persistence, focus, and
    attentiveness to possibility—will give her a huge boost in creating her own luck
    in life. When you say someone is lucky, what you really mean is that all three
    of the key elements—chance, talent, and hard work—converged for a great result.
    Even if the end point seems as wondrous and magical as finding a four-leaf clover,
    her actions led to it in one way or another. Even if she didn’t realize it.

  zh: 那个说Sunny会从幸运变得更幸运的小朋友可能是对的（而且这并不是因为Sunny现在有了四叶草）。让Sunny最初找到那株四叶草的品质——坚持、专注和对可能性的敏感——将会在她的人生中给她带来巨大的幸运。当你说某人很幸运时，你真正的意思是，三个关键因素——机遇、才华和努力——汇聚在一起，产生了一个很棒的结果。即使最终结果看起来像是发现了四叶草那样奇妙和神奇，她的行动以某种方式促成了这一结果。即使她没有意识到这一点。
- en: Thinking of herself as a lucky person, and having others see her that way, will
    only add to Sunny’s advantages. Luck comes in cascades. When you start on a lucky
    path, you tend to stay there. I pictured some of those sweet seven-year-olds going
    home and complaining at dinner about their friend’s good luck. *How come she found
    the four-leaf clover? She’s always sooo lucky. How come I didn’t find it?* An
    appeasing parent might promise, “You’ll get lucky and find it next time.” But
    while that may make dinner calmer, it won’t do anything to assure that the child
    really *does* improve her luck. Whether you’re seven or seventy, if you see yourself
    as buffeted by forces over which you have no control, you tend to give up and
    lament your fate. Better to remind the young seeker of four-leaf clovers that
    she can change her luck with focus and effort.

  zh: 认为自己是个幸运的人，并且让别人也这样看待自己，将会进一步增加Sunny的优势。幸运是会成串到来的。当你走上了幸运的道路，你往往会一直走下去。我想象着那些可爱的七岁小朋友回家后，在晚餐时抱怨自己朋友的好运。*为什么她找到了四叶草？她总是那么幸运，为什么我没找到？*
    一个宽慰的家长可能会答应道：“你下次会幸运的，找到它的。”但虽然这能让晚餐气氛平和一些，却不会让孩子的运气真的改善。无论你是七岁还是七十岁，如果你认为自己被无可控制的力量左右，你往往会放弃并哀叹命运。倒不如提醒那个年轻的四叶草寻找者，她可以通过专注和努力改变自己的运气。
- en: In his play *A Streetcar Named Desire*, playwright Tennessee Williams gave tough
    guy Stanley Kowalski the great line “You know what luck is? Luck is believing
    you’re lucky, that’s all.” Stanley—played by Marlon Brando in the movie—might
    not have been the brightest (or nicest) guy around, but he looked great in a T-shirt,
    and he was definitely right about luck. “To hold a front position in this rat
    race, you’ve got to believe you are lucky,” he said.[*](33_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1)

    Or you could have had a few too many tequila shots at the party and been too blurry-eyed
    to notice the handsome spouse-to-be lurking by the guacamole. Similarly, George
    Lucas hiring Harrison Ford to build his cabinets was a (more or less) random event

    and after she and Alice became friends, Alice helped her negotiate a big book

    simple serendipity. But luck rarely appears from nowhere. Lucky seeds have to

    miserable as a lawyer, her eyes were probably open for other opportunities. Having

    of you, no doubt) when a big SUV pulls out of a spot. You swoop in and, with the
    motor still running, check the sign—and discover the spot is even legal. Whoop-de-doo!

    random, everyone should be equally good at it, and that’s not the case. A lot
    of people will tell you that they’re simply lousy at street parking (count me
    among them) and would never even try it, while others, including my husband, Ron,
    are masterful. He drives to the theater or other evening events in Manhattan at
    least a couple of times a week, and he never, ever goes to a parking lot. He doesn’t
    have a rabbit’s foot hanging from his rearview mirror, but he does have a few

    getting into a parked car on a side street or the slight motion of an engine turning
    on, and he’ll immediately head in that direction. He also relies on his great
    memory and head for numbers—different streets allow parking at different hours—to
    know exactly which street will be the best bet. With his combination of experience,

    down metaphoric dark tunnels, hoping for something special and rewarding at the
    end—a better job, greater success, a chance to meet Prince, or Princess, Charming.
    And there are indeed always pitfalls and potholes we can fall into. Being able
    to shed some light on the situation makes us luckier and better able to manage
    the risks and opportunities.

    one—the ability to pay attention and notice opportunities. A great example of
    how easy it is to miss something important comes from the psychologists Christopher
    Chabris and Daniel Simons, who met some twenty years ago at Harvard University
    and began doing research on attention and perception. They created a now-famous
    video in which six college-age men and women, half in black T-shirts and half
    in white ones, are moving around, and you’re asked to count how many times the
    players wearing white shirts pass the basketball.[*](35_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_3)
    Okay, you can do this. You focus carefully on the players in white and watch the
    ball. At the end of the short video, the announcer’s voice asks how many passes
    you counted. If you get the correct answer of fifteen, you probably pat yourself
    on the back. Good observing! But the next question may change your mind: “Did
    you see the gorilla?”'

  zh: 任何看似幸运的人最重要的天赋是一个非常基本的能力——注意力和发现机会的能力。心理学家克里斯托弗·查布里斯（Christopher Chabris）和丹尼尔·西蒙斯（Daniel
    Simons）给出了一个很好的例子，说明了错过重要事情有多么容易。他们二十多年前在哈佛大学相遇，开始研究注意力和感知。他们制作了一段现在非常著名的视频，其中六个大学生穿着黑色和白色的T恤，围绕着运动，而你被要求数一下穿白色T恤的球员传球的次数。[*](35_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_3)
    好吧，你可以做到这一点。你仔细地关注穿白色衣服的球员，并观察篮球。视频结束时，解说员的声音问你数到了多少次传球。如果你得到了正确的答案——十五次，你可能会为自己感到骄傲。观察得很好！但是下一个问题可能会改变你的想法：“你看到大猩猩了吗？”
- en: Um . . . the gorilla? Halfway through the game, a person in a gorilla costume
    came to the middle of the screen, beat his chest, and walked off. Whoops. In experiments
    that have been done over and over with people of all ages and backgrounds (starting
    with Harvard students), at least half miss the gorilla. If you haven’t seen the
    video, you’re probably convinced that of course you would see the gorilla. Everybody
    thinks that. But you get so busy counting passes that you simply miss the other
    action that’s happening right in front of you.

  zh: 嗯……大猩猩？在游戏进行到一半时，一个穿着大猩猩服装的人走到屏幕中央，捶打胸口，然后走开了。哎呀。在反复进行的实验中（从哈佛学生开始），无论年龄和背景如何，至少一半的人都没看到大猩猩。如果你还没看过这段视频，你可能确信自己当然会看到大猩猩。每个人都这么想。但你忙着数传球次数，以至于完全错过了眼前发生的其他事情。
- en: The video got so much attention when it first appeared that the researchers
    did an update. I found it online and tried it out. This time, I knew about the
    gorilla, so even as I was counting the passes, I noticed him coming in and felt
    pretty good about myself. (I can see everything!) But the researchers had another
    surprise at the end. Did you notice that one of the players walked off the court?
    Or that the color of the background curtain changed in the middle of the game
    from red to gold? If you’re like most people, including me, the answers are no
    and no.

  zh: 这段视频刚发布时引起了极大的关注，因此研究人员做了一个更新版。我在网上找到了并尝试了一下。这次，我知道了大猩猩的存在，所以即使我在数传球，我也注意到了它的出现，感觉自己挺不错的。（我能看到一切！）但是研究人员在结尾时给出了另一个惊喜。你注意到有一个球员走出了场地吗？或者你注意到游戏进行中背景的幕布从红色变成了金色吗？如果你和我一样，答案是没有，没有。
- en: If you’re overlooking a gorilla beating his chest and a background changing
    color, there’s a good chance that you’re missing a lot of things all around you—many
    that could turn into luck. So how do you change that? Barnaby and I were mulling
    that when we attended a conference in Chicago and happened to be seated one night
    with two neuroscientists who do research in the area of attention. Over dinner,
    where I definitely noticed the excellent grilled fish, I brought up the invisible
    gorilla and the problem of knowing where to look. Dr. Ed Hamlin, who has taught
    at Duke and the University of North Carolina and now runs the Center for the Advancement
    of Human Potential in Asheville, explained that good attention is flexible, allowing
    us to switch between narrow focus and open focus. In the gorilla video, you’re
    narrowly focused on counting the passes, so you miss the bigger picture. If you
    allow yourself to watch the scene with a wider view, you see the gorilla, but
    you can’t count the passes.

  zh: 如果你忽略了大猩猩捶胸和背景颜色的变化，那很可能你错过了周围的许多事物——其中很多可能会转变为运气。那么你该如何改变这种情况呢？巴纳比和我在芝加哥参加一个会议时正在思考这个问题，我们恰好与两位从事注意力领域研究的神经科学家共进晚餐。在晚餐时，我无疑注意到了那道美味的烤鱼，我提到了那个看不见的大猩猩以及知道该看哪里的问题。哈姆林博士，曾在杜克大学和北卡罗来纳大学教书，现在在阿什维尔经营“人类潜力发展中心”，解释说，良好的注意力是灵活的，它让我们能够在狭窄的聚焦和广泛的关注之间切换。在大猩猩的视频中，你专注于计算传球次数，所以错过了更大的画面。如果你允许自己从更广阔的视角看这个场景，你就能看到大猩猩，但却无法计算传球次数。

- en: “Good attention is flexible,” said Dr. Hamlin. “You always have to adjust to
    demands and circumstances.” A baseball fan, he described the All-Star game he’d
    just watched in which the second baseman bobbled a ball hit his way. “He’d probably
    done that play hundreds of times in practice and never missed it. But this time
    he looked up to see where the runner was, and he lost his focus.” The ability
    to switch from the narrow view to the wider one can be the key to a lucky play—or
    a mortifying miss.

- en: Shifting your attention and recognizing the right place to look at the right
    moment isn’t always easy. Dr. Hamlin admitted that even though he works with attention
    problems, his wife complains that he never knows when dinner is ready. He’s so
    busy burrowing into the work in front of him that he misses other signals—like
    the fact that it’s seven-thirty at night and the smell of roasted chicken is wafting

- en: Barnaby, who has a great ability to concentrate, pointed out that even though
    we were sitting in a noisy restaurant with the din of conversation all around
    us, if somebody on the other side of the room said his name, he would immediately
    hear it. Our other dinner companion, David Ziegler, a researcher in neuroscience
    at the University of California School of Medicine, San Francisco, described that
    as pop-out attention—the things that grab our notice no matter what. More important
    (and subtle) is top-down attention, the events and circumstances that we notice
    only when we focus.

- en: All of us are bombarded each day with millions of bits of information, and we
    get lucky when we know where we want to focus—or which possibilities we want to

    bytes of data every day—which you can write out as 2,500,000,000,000,000,000,
    if that helps you see just how big a number we’re talking about. Needless to say,
    we’re not built to take in even the tiniest fraction of that. Possibilities abound
    in every direction, and if you wait for one of those bytes or possibilities or
    bits of stimulus to turn into luck, you’re sure to miss it. As with the gorilla
    video, you have to know where you’re looking—because it takes looking in the right
    place to get lucky.
