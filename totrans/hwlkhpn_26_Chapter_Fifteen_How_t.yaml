    from the socializing one afternoon and sat in the back of a classroom as a young
    professor of geology named Maureen Long talked about earthquakes. And tsunamis.
    And other problems related to natural disasters. I left thinking I should have
    been a geology major—which clearly shows what a good teacher she is.

    experience with. He explained that his mom had trained in arts and design and
    knew nothing about seismic science, but she was spirited and entrepreneurial and
    got the Alaska job anyway. She learned the science quickly and tried to raise
    earthquake awareness through programs in schools and public brochures. But she
    was stymied at every turn by powerful people who owned land and property in vulnerable
    spots—and didn’t want the topic discussed.

    set of plates in the world,” Barnaby told me. A great earthquake that struck on
    Good Friday of 1964 was the most powerful in the history of America and the second-most
    powerful ever recorded in the world (9.2 on the Richter scale). Given Alaska’s
    sparse population, casualties were limited, though more than a hundred people
    died in the tsunamis that followed.

    real estate interests worried about property values. “Eventually they realized
    there was some grassroots interest in the safety of buildings,” she told us.

    areas. During an earthquake, the buildings on top of them could be vulnerable.

    the Earth can exchange material between its interior and its oceans over millions
    of years might play a role in regulating the very long-term carbon cycle of the
    planet. It speaks to a lot of fundamental questions about what allowed life to
    develop.”

    plate shiftings mean earthquakes are a lot more common than you think. There are
    about fifteen magnitude 7 earthquakes a year—and you don’t want to be around when
    one hits. Many of them happen far away from people and infrastructure, so we don’t
    hear about them on the evening news. But then comes one like the 2010 Haiti earthquake,
    which killed well over 100,000 people (some estimates go much higher) and offered
    a devastating reminder that poor infrastructure and a complete lack of preparedness
    can lead to very, very bad luck.

    can give you time to prepare. The earthquake that rumbled under the Indian Ocean
    in 2004 was a magnitude 9 (the third largest ever recorded) and unleashed a devastating
    tsunami. The first waves—really walls of water—that ravaged the coast of Thailand
    came quickly. Vacationers lolling on the beaches were submerged in the swirling
    water, and there was no obvious way to prepare to be lucky. But across the ocean,
    waves continued to propagate, and tens of thousands of fatalities occurred in
    places far away, many hours later. “You need systems in place ahead of time so
    people can be warned and evacuate,” said Professor Long. Without these systems,
    the tsunami killed some 250,000 people in fourteen countries.

    situations for years. He’s looked at everything from wilderness accidents to plane
    crashes, trying to understand who survives and who doesn’t. In a long conversation
    with him, we discovered that when it comes to disaster preparedness, Gonzales
    is a do-everything kind of guy. He told us that he and his wife had been at a
    doctor’s office the previous day when a fire alarm went off. She was writing a
    check at the reception desk “and she didn’t even hesitate. She dropped her checkbook,
    walked over to me, and we went straight to the exit and out. Was it a false alarm?
    It usually is. But if an alarm goes off, you leave the building. Otherwise why
    have a fire alarm?”

    an alarm. We hesitate, we try to get more information, we see what everybody else
    is doing. Our instinct is to believe that everything is okay. Many years ago,
    my husband and I were asleep in our suburban home with our (then) very young children
    down the hall. At about three A.M., the burglar alarm sounded and the phone rang
    immediately, with our alarm company calling to check. My husband reached for the

    Examined Life*, he points out how difficult it is for us to break our usual patterns.
    My husband is competent and self-sufficient, and those traits usually work out
    well. They are his instinctive fallback. He had never encountered an alarm in
    our home that *wasn’t* set off by mistake. But hearing an alarm in the middle
    of the night, he might have done better to try shutting off his natural instincts.
    Grosz said that in one nightclub fire, some people went to pay their checks before
    leaving and others died because they tried to leave through the door they entered.
    Oftentimes people simply linger too long—they may smell the smoke, but they wait
    to see the flames. “We resist change. Committing ourselves to a small change,
    even one that is unmistakably in our best interest, is often more frightening
    than ignoring a dangerous situation,” he said.

    to almost anything. He described how his little granddaughter first saw a garbage
    truck when she was not yet two years old, and she was scared and excited as it
    roared by. But once she had seen the truck enough times, she stopped noticing
    it. “She incorporated it into a model that allows her to proceed through life
    efficiently,” he told us.

    or scared by every event. You acclimatize. You recognize that not everything needs
    your attention. But sometimes you become so comfortable that you don’t realize
    when you’re facing danger. Gonzales told us that on the Gulf Coast of Texas, where
    he grew up, people would have hurricane parties. “You didn’t get out of town or
    go into a big building to protect yourself—you ordered a bunch of booze and had
    your friends over,” he said. Before one very big hurricane some years ago, the
    sheriff headed over to a row of apartment houses on a Galveston beach to warn
    people that the storm was coming and they needed to leave. One group that was
    partying on a fifth-floor balcony called back, “Hey, don’t sweat it, we do this
    every year”—and they just laughed and waved.

    guidelines that kick in, and your rational brain would have to purposefully override

    your thumb with a hammer). But to be the lucky survivor, you sometimes have to
    fight against all those instincts. “If you can bring your higher brain, your logical
    brain, into the picture, then you can start to manage these automatic responses
    in a way that’s going to be useful,” Gonzales said.

    seems to fit the list, as does sharpening knives or playing a musical instrument
    or a game of pool. “They all have a linear step-by-step engagement of the thinking
    brain that has a calming effect, because it engages the neocortex and helps you
    dominate your emotional responses,” said Gonzales.

    life as a doctor, Ron is faced by daily crises and emergencies. He needs that
    higher-brain ability to cope with them rationally and unemotionally, and maybe

    hard work that defines luck in other circumstances. The right person can control
    the randomness of a crisis and produce a lucky result. Sullenberger had been flying

    luck? In 2013, scientists and test pilots purposely crashed a Boeing 727 filled
    with sensors and test dummies in the Mexican desert. They found that the back
    of the plane is the safest place to be. About 78 percent of the passengers in
    the back section would have survived, while those in the first dozen rows didn’t
    do as well. (Being in the middle of the plane—over the wings—was, well, in the

    in all directions.”

    of all. The guys who were partying as the hurricane came in and the people who
    stayed at the nightclub as the fire broke out were all victims of wishful thinking.
    *Nothing bad can happen because it hasn’t before.* During the Ebola outbreak,
    Dr. Sabeti became frustrated with policy makers whose approach was “maybe it won’t
    spread to Sierra Leone, or maybe it won’t come to America. Magical or wishful
    thinking isn’t the way to make a decision.”

    clear-sighted planning. “Some people think that if you get an insurance policy,
    you’re willing something bad to happen, but it’s really quite the opposite. You
    batten down the hatches so that you can relax. If you’ve thought about the worst-case
    scenario, you’re prepared for everything. In the context of this outbreak, I would
    see people working from the premise that the virus wouldn’t mutate. Much better
    to say, ‘Maybe it will mutate—and then what?’”

    alarmist. She found herself telling people over and over, “Don’t be scared, be
    prepared.” At one point early in the Ebola outbreak, before any cases had come
    to America, she was giving a talk at a conference of Harvard’s biggest donors.
    “I told all these billionaires to go out and get a bunch of canned products that
    would allow them to stay inside for twenty-one days. I didn’t say it to make them
    panic and go crazy, but let’s say in an ideal world you have twenty-one days of
    canned food at home, the outbreak gets resolved quickly, and you give the food
    to the homeless. Isn’t that better than if you wait, wait, wait, thinking everything
    will be okay—and then it’s not okay? Then you have scenes like in the movies where
    people are punching each other in grocery stores.”

    It’s true on a global scale, where shared findings usually lead to better public
    health outcomes. And it’s also true for an individual. If you understand what’s
    going on, you can take reasonable steps and avoid mass hysteria. She’s currently
    trying to create a global outbreak surveillance system, starting with an app that
    Harvard students can use when they have an infection. They input their symptoms
    and get information about what might be wrong. An individual diagnosis is hard
    to make in infectious disease—“99 percent of the time you have no idea what it
    is, but just hope it’s not lethal,” she said—but when it’s a shared event with
    multiple samplings, the signal-to-noise ratio improves. There’s more chance of
    recognizing the start of an outbreak.

    is understanding what you can control and what you can’t and so avoiding the panic.”

    we all focus on how unremarkable the circumstances were in which the unthinkable
    occurred,” she said. Tragedy can come from the clear blue sky—often literally.
    The morning of September 11, 2001, was clear and cloudless, and people often describe
    the sunshine of that morning with a kind of awe—as if there should have been some
    greater warning, some black clouds and thunderstorms, before the planes struck
    the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.

    after the Ebola crisis, she was invited to give the opening talk at a conference
    of world leaders—the kind of event where politicians and celebrities and Silicon
    Valley stars and global leaders all gather. You can imagine Ashton Kutcher and
    the president of Mexico jamming with Senator Cory Booker and a high-tech CEO.
    In the mornings they hear smart talks and in the afternoons engage with one another
    in sports activities that Dr. Sabeti described as “insane and way too risky.”

    prepared for the day with an hour and a half of stretching and handstands “and
    other crazy stuff.” Her talk was extremely well received, and everyone was busy
    discussing it afterward and gathering around her. “People started weighing in
    on what I should do for the afternoon,” she said. Her original plan for rope climbing
    got shunted aside when she discovered a participant the previous year had shattered
    an ankle. So she switched to an ATV tour when she was told it was the safest option.

    very specific questions about safety,” she said. “Little did I know that even

    the driver lost control and jumped out and we went over a cliff.”

    and knees and caused head injuries. Dr. Sabeti was flown from Montana to a trauma
    center in Seattle, where she went through twenty-five hours of surgery in four
    days. “Doctors said I had a 5 to 8 percent chance of survival. Most people with
    this kind of multiple trauma die. I’m one of the luckiest of the unluckiest.”

    or a devastating accident—the survivors don’t just pick up their lives where they
    left off. They are forever changed. They are stunned by the random chance that
    left them living and also slightly overwhelmed to realize that their own actions
    contributed to their fate. In the unluckiest of circumstances, they found a way
    to emerge as one of the lucky survivors. It is scary and sobering. Dr. Sabeti’s
    physical struggles may never go away. But she will continue making luck for herself
    and others.
