    the subject of lucky breaks—and I began thinking about a lovely young woman who
    works in the grocery store near my house in rural Connecticut. Always eager to
    help, she has a gentle style, a warm smile, and an air of competence that her
    IGA apron can’t hide. Plus, she’s quite beautiful, with the slightly exotic looks
    of the first assistant I hired when I was a TV producer.

    everything. Your boss quits and hands you his job, your start-up sells for a billion
    dollars, or your YouTube video goes viral and makes you famous. Actress Shirley
    MacLaine was just out of high school and an understudy for the Broadway production
    of *The Pajama Game* when the starring actress broke her ankle—and MacLaine landed
    center stage. A very literal lucky break! (Though only for one of them.)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Those earth-shattering events do happen, but Barnaby was right. Like MacLaine’s,
    your lucky break could lead to a career marked by six Academy Award nominations—or
    it could lead to absolutely nothing. Because if you’re not prepared, you’re going
    to blow the chance you’ve been given.

- en: The real secret is knowing what to do *after* the big opportunity comes—because
    a lucky break is not the same as a lucky outcome. In our slot machine of chance,
    talent, and hard work, a lucky break is the big cherry of chance. But you still
    need those other two cherries lined up. We’ve all heard the stories of athletes
    with multimillion-dollar contracts who get arrested and thrown out of their sport,
    or lottery winners who end up penniless and angry. A lucky break turns out to
    be like any other opportunity. You can recognize that it’s in front of you and
    make it part of a lucky life. Or you can mishandle it so it leads to nothing—or
    disaster.
  prefs: []

- en: You’ll be able to make the most of a lucky break only if you’ve laid the proper
    foundation for it. MacLaine didn’t just waltz (or tap-dance) onto the Broadway
    stage—she had been preparing to be a dancer since she was three years old. Acting
    was also in the family genes. (Her brother is actor Warren Beatty.) When she had
    the chance to be onstage, she was fully prepared. Similarly, if you buy a lottery
    ticket with an actual idea of what you’ll do with any winnings, you’ll be in a
    better position to handle the windfall than if you’ve just fantasized that big
    bucks will change your life. The chances of winning are so small that preparing
    ahead probably isn’t worth it in this case. But you get the point.

    little crack. A small advantage can grow into something big and bigger. If you’re

    on itself. The challenge is to realize how a tiny lucky break can become an enormous

    moments of luck. Everybody has probably heard by now that penicillin, Post-it
    notes, and Velcro were discovered by accident. Supposed lucky breaks like those
    take on almost mythic proportions. But you have to be careful about giving too
    much credence to the serendipitous lucky break that led to the discovery or invention.
    Because that undermines the truer story of the determined efforts (before and
    after) that really create luck.
  prefs: []

    when Alexander Fleming found mold growing in one of his petri dishes. As the story
    goes, he went away for a month-long family vacation in September 1928 and left
    several petri dishes with *Staphylococcus* bacteria on the windowsill of his lab.
    When he got back, one of the dishes was contaminated with mold. And lo and behold,
    the bacteria surrounding the mold had been destroyed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He didn’t shout, “Eureka!” or go running naked through the streets (as Archimedes
    reportedly once did),[*](57_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_4) but he did realize that
    the mold might have inhibited the bacterial growth. And there you have it—one
    lucky break and millions of people have been saved from diseases like strep throat
    and scarlet fever, as well as wound infections.
  prefs: []

    to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world’s first antibiotic, or
    bacteria killer. But I suppose that was exactly what I did,” Fleming said later.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The revolution wasn’t quite as casual as all that. During World War I, Fleming
    had been in the Royal Army Medical Corps doing research into wound infections
    and antiseptics. After the war, he returned to his lab at St. Mary’s Hospital
    at the University of London, and by 1921, he had made his first big discovery,
    finding an enzyme that fights bacteria.
  prefs: []

    into one of his bacteria cultures. Are you starting to see a pattern here? The
    dropped mucus and the plopped mold were serendipitous, but they were common events.
    It wasn’t their occurrence that was so lucky and magical, but what Fleming made
    of them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the time of his family vacation, Fleming had been working on questions about
    bacteria and the human immune system for more than a decade. As is often the case
    in science, he had many small breakthroughs and lots of incremental steps. Many
    of the things he tried didn’t lead anywhere. When one does pay off, it’s not random
    luck—it’s the result of months and years of focused energy, and plenty of experiments
    that didn’t pan out.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    into Fleming’s lab after that vacation might have tossed away the contaminated
    petri dish without a second thought. One man’s scientific breakthrough is another
    man’s yucky, moldy mess.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And despite the lucky break, Fleming didn’t revolutionize medicine on September
    28\. The real challenge came afterward, as it so often does. He added two researchers
    to his team, but he wasn’t successful in isolating and purifying the “mold juice.”
    Not long after, two scientists at the University of Oxford, Howard Florey and
    Ernst Chain, led a team that finally created the first usable doses of penicillin.
    They ultimately shared a Nobel Prize with Fleming.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the moral that intelligence and hard work pay off. Fleming’s story had magic and
    mystery—the distracted scientist, the messy lab, the mold plopping into a dish
    placed on a windowsill. Luck . . . serendipity . . . and the world is changed!
    But the lucky break was only one step in the chain. Much had to occur ahead of
    time for it to mean anything, and even more had to happen afterward for it to
    pay off.

    become Shirley MacLaine (or her equivalent), we don’t have any reason to remember
    them. The lessons of the past are helpful only if we can use them to recognize
    the lucky break when it happens to *us.*

    break that pays off isn’t as easy as it might sound. Back in 1981, the philanthropist
    Eugene Lang was speaking to a group of sixth-graders at the school in East Harlem
    that he had attended fifty years earlier. As he looked out at the sixty-one children
    from low-income families, the idea struck him of offering them a collective lucky
    break. He made an impromptu offer: He would pay the college tuition of every one
    who graduated from high school.'

    headlines around the country. In interviews, Lang pointed out that it wasn’t just
    the money that made the difference but the ability of the children to dream. Somebody
    cared about them. He quickly realized that the big break he was offering—free
    tuition—wouldn’t do anything if the kids didn’t have the grit or interest or vision
    to stay in school. So he put people in place who could tutor and help support
    the kids and their struggling parents.

    of the lucky break and went on to college—some to schools as prestigious as Swarthmore
    and Barnard. That doesn’t sound like a lot—until you hear that before Lang’s offer,
    the principal had estimated that only one kid from the class would ever make it
    to college.

    look back and recognize the people along the way who helped and supported them—parents

    of giving a lucky break to kids who wouldn’t otherwise have one is compelling.

    get better jobs and family outcomes—but that didn’t seem to happen. Chetty decided
    to look at the results from a different perspective. Many of the families had
    small children when they moved. Did the lucky break change *their* lives? Some
    twenty years later, Chetty discovered that the results were actually quite remarkable
    for the kids who moved when they were under five.

    the housing moves, the lucky break has to be given at the right time in a child’s
    life. And as with the college-tuition programs, it won’t work for everyone. The
    people who receive the lucky break still have to recognize that they’ve been handed
    an opportunity and act on it.

    twenty or so men and women who receive the “genius awards” every year from the
    MacArthur Foundation aren’t required to act on their lucky break, since each one
    gets $625,000 over five years with no strings attached. The winners have already
    proven that they have talent and a willingness to work hard—two strands of the
    luck equation. But when given the final strand of chance (in the form of the unexpected
    fellowship), they recognize the lucky opportunity and want to take advantage of
    it, even if nobody is checking up on them. When I called Cecilia Conrad, the MacArthur
    Foundation managing director who oversees the awards (officially called a MacArthur
    Fellowship), she immediately concurred.

    a confidential nominating and evaluation process so nobody knows they’re being
    considered. And even if you have a suspicion that you’re in the running, you can’t
    sit around waiting for the news because there’s no fixed date for the announcement.
    So when the winners get the call from Conrad announcing their award, they’re usually
    flustered and flummoxed. It feels like a bolt from the blue. The ultimate lucky
    break.

    see it as a chance to become more public scholars or intellectuals.”

    Yes, poets and playwrights win, but MacArthur has also recognized blacksmithing

    herself and asked Basting if she was in a place to have a private conversation.
    Hearing that she was in the car, Conrad suggested she pull over.

    to win a genius award, and only a handful of the winners (close to 1,000 since
    the awards began in 1981) have ever hailed from that state at all. The foundation
    created a map showing where all the MacArthur Fellows were born and where they
    lived when they won the award—and (aside from the international winners),[*](58_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_5)
    New York and California come out on top in both counts. When you adjust for population,
    the prominence of winners *born* in those states isn’t surprising, but much more
    dramatic is where people *ended up*. Well over half were living in New York, California,
    and Massachusetts when they got the lucky fellowship.

    to humanities to teaching, you may need to buy a plane ticket. “There’s an element
    of putting yourself in places where luck might find you,” Conrad said. “The complementarities
    for people in the same place make more opportunities for luck to happen. Big cities
    draw more creative and original types, and there are also clusters around top
    educational institutions.”

    you pave the way for your own good fortune. It starts with “basic competency,
    skills, and hard work—and being passionate about possibilities,” she said. Then
    comes a willingness to pursue your passions without an obvious end in sight. “The
    payoff may be far off and outside the norm. You have to take risks and be willing
    to fail—which is a form of resilience.”

    about the deep impact her work would have. “I don’t follow the same benchmarks
    for success that other people do,” she admitted. “My satisfaction for the work
    is what keeps me persevering. I count the importance of my work by how it makes
    me feel. And I know that when others see it, they feel the power of it, too.”
    A willingness to find your own niche and dance on the creative edges, no matter
    what the result, brings its own good luck. You become the only judge of what matters,
    and with or without a fellowship, the work feels like a lucky break.

    sort of follow-through at play here—a lucky break can have a huge multiplier effect.
    When you change one person’s life, you can have a domino effect on others. Anne
    Basting works with people with dementia (“please don’t call them patients,” she
    said), and her lucky break with the genius award means she can spread the wealth
    and the opportunities to more of the elderly who need it.

    into the lucky-break business in the biggest way possible—offering a hundred-million-dollar
    grant to a single project. A hundred million dollars. That’s big bucks no matter
    how you look at it. Conrad told me that the foundation’s 100&Change competition
    gave a payout ten or a hundred times bigger than the biggest grants that foundations
    typically give. And it came with almost no guidelines. The idea wasn’t just to
    figure out the solution to a problem—but to decide what problem needed to be solved.

    requirements, and only 800 were passed on to the judges. If you want a lucky break
