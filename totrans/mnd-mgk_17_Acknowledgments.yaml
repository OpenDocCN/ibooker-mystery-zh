    Discover the Mysteries of the Brain and the Secrets of the Heart*, it became evident
    that an important theme was the reality that one could manifest one’s intentions.
    I realized this concept was critically important, as so many readers commented
    on it and wanted to learn more. Yet there seemed to be confusion as to exactly
    what manifestation was, and many connected it with the idea that somehow the universe
    or some external force would grant them their wishes—which often related to obtaining
    wealth, power, or position—and by doing so, they would be happy. This idea has
    been promulgated by many who have promoted the concept of the Law of Attraction
    and the notion that if I just got more for myself, then I would be happy. Nothing
    could be further from the truth, and sadly, this idea reinforces a narrative that
    leads to emptiness and unhappiness, which is the opposite of creating a life of
    meaning, purpose, and, ultimately, happiness.'

    of how one is able to embed one’s intentions into the brain to actually allow
    for manifestation to occur. This took me on a long trek involving history, philosophy,
    psychology, and neuroscience. But even beyond this, it resulted in me exploring
    in depth the concept of self-agency and the power each of us has within us to
    change our brains, which led me back to many of the things I discussed in my first
    book. So it seems that I have come full circle.

    agent, Doug Abrams at Idea Architects, who was enthusiastically supportive. We
    created a proposal that we presented to the amazing Caroline Sutton, editor-in-chief
    of Avery (an imprint of Penguin Random House), the publisher of my first book.
    She was immediately on board. Her support, encouragement, and guidance has been
    greatly appreciated.

    One of the first things I did was a deep dive into the science behind the topic,
    reading many books and hundreds of articles. My dear friend Monica Bucci, MD,
    kindly offered to read through the books and articles as well, and helped me by
    organizing and summarizing the literature and giving me much appreciated input
    and advice as the project progressed. Next, Idea Architects was kind enough to
    recommend Alexander Nemser to collaborate with me, not only in regard to organizing
    my thoughts but also to assist in turning what could have been a somewhat dry
    topic into a compelling narrative, intertwining the science with stories that
    I had shared with him. In the process, Alexander has become a close friend.

    support I try not to take for granted. My wife has always remained supportive
    of my endeavors in promoting the power of compassion to change lives. For this
    I am forever grateful.
