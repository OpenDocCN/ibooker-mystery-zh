    for a mile or two until they met the street the public library was on. The gravel
    crunched under our sneakers as the Southern California heat haze shimmered above
    the steel tracks. Grateful for the air conditioning in the library, we lingered
    among the shelves, then finally we would check out the maximum of ten books each
    and carry them in our arms all the way back along the tracks to read in the bedroom
    we shared. Although each of us was on our own mostly private journey (my brother
    was discovering his talent as a visual artist and exploring his identity as a
    gay teen), I was still grateful for the way the ritual gave us time to be together,
    and I remember the pleasure I felt walking slightly behind him on the tracks,
    our arms weighed down by our latest treasures.

    of transcendence from the limited and painful environment I was living in. Without
    a wise guide to rein me in, I began experimenting with the practices of “soul
    travel” and out-of-body experiences. One night, I lay on my bed, did a breathing
    practice, and attempted to travel with my soul to other planes of reality. At
    first, nothing happened. Then, with a mixture of delight and uneasiness, I sensed
    my awareness as it rose up out of my body. My consciousness floated to the windowsill
    above the battalion of green plastic G.I. Joes and passed through the window and
    up into the branches of the tree outside, where I could sit and look back down
    on my own body resting in the bedroom. The sensation of being in two places at
    once, of experiencing two selves at once, was scary but also exhilarating, and
    seemed to offer a pathway to the freedom and independence I craved. It would have
    thrilled me to know that sixteen years later, the CIA would produce an official
    report on the application of such experiences that predicted teams of agents going
    out-of-body together and sending their detached consciousnesses across the world
    to spy on top-secret Soviet military projects in the name of national security.

    I kept my journeys secret from everyone including my brother, so I had no teacher
    or mentor to guide me or advise me to slow down. Now, instead of stopping at the
    tree outside my window or a physical landmark on earth, I exited my body and rose
    through the atmosphere until I was so high, I could no longer see my body back
    in my bedroom. The first stage was total blackness and, no longer aware of the
    world below, I realized I could move within the blackness and travel to other,
    further places. I visited levels completely shrouded in fog and began to notice
    that in some places I felt an incredible sense of love and connection, and in
    others it was quite the opposite—I had a sense of the presence of various threatening
    and malevolent spirits floating out there. It was as if I were moving through
    a room filled with dense smoke, where I couldn’t see any forms but could feel
    their evil presence as they drew closer to me.

    was going to be taken over by one of these spirits. Sometimes I would cry out
    in terror and wake my brother, but he assumed I was just having a nightmare. Today
    you could argue that I was having what is known as a *hypnagogic hallucination*,
    a fleeting perceptual experience that occurs during the transition from wakefulness
    to sleep, when awareness of the environment drops away but brain stem activity
    continues. What I didn’t know at the time was that these experiences were giving
    me my first lesson in consciously working with my amygdala, the part of the limbic
    system in the brain that is responsible for regulating emotions such as fear and
    anxiety, and that the amygdala is the first gatekeeper in the brain when it comes

    the “evil spirits,” but my reaction to it was different. This time, I intuitively
    understood that the manifestation of those entities came from my own vulnerability

    into me, and I absorbed it and no longer feared it. Once I no longer resisted,
    I no longer felt fear, which then allowed me to integrate it into myself and gave
    me the insight that, while it was part of me, I did not have to allow it to be

    because I began learning how to work with the amygdala. With practice, we can
    learn to accept that the amygdala will accompany us on our journeys, doing its
    job of trying to protect and care for our physical survival, but we do not need
    to let it make our decisions for us. Specifically, we do not let it choose where
    we direct our attention. As we will see in the following chapters, the practice
    of manifestation rests on our ability to direct our attention toward the objects
    of our intention (selective attention) and away from objects and experiences that
    distract it. Consciously directing our attention where we choose is the key to
    our inner power. The more skill we develop in learning to watch our experience
    without becoming emotionally activated, the more skill we have in placing and
    keeping our attention on the things we want to manifest.

    the amygdala. The amygdala is very involved in our salience network (SN), a collection
    of regions in the brain that decide which stimuli deserve our attention. The SN
    is constantly filtering the information coming through our senses and making rapid-fire
    judgments about what is most important to process and respond to. As part of the
    limbic system, the amygdala has the power to immediately reroute all our cognitive
    resources to focus exclusively on physical survival. The more fear we bring to
    an event, the more we are telling the amygdala that the salience of the event
    is very high and very threatening; and the less fear we bring, the less we are
    going to activate the threat salience, leaving our attention free to be directed
    as we choose.

    SNS. It is based primarily in our brain stem, is the oldest part of our brain,
    and has been present in our human ancestors for millions of years. Essentially,
    its job was to keep us alive in our original niche environment. As a result, it
    is the very thing that has been associated with our survival as a species, and
    that is why it is so deeply rooted in and attached to us. As the ancient key to
    our success as organic life, the SNS remains with us today as a prevalent force
    within our subconscious directing actions it believes are beneficial to our survival.
    In other words, evolution typically does not discard, it includes. While the attributes
    of the SNS served a purpose when our species lived on the savanna in Africa, in
    modern society it results for many in a negative ongoing dialogue in their head.
    In a sense, negativity is the first language of our species, and we must learn,
    slowly and painstakingly, to speak a new one.

    dangers, it has followed us into our modern world and now tries to protect our
    sense of *self* from the countless small assaults of our interconnected reality.
    Where the fight response may once have helped us defend ourselves against a marauding
    tiger, it now causes us to fight against the parts of ourselves that we believe
    do not measure up, triggering overpowering emotions of shame and the feeling that
    we are not good enough. The volume of the inner critic and its sense of *relational*
    threat (“What will people think? Who do you think you are?”) is now deployed in
    a chronic maladaptation; it has undergone the unfortunate metamorphosis into the
    inner critic we know all too well today. Particularly tricky for us as manifesters
    is the *negativity bias*, a system of value tagging that makes warnings of danger
    stand out in our minds as most salient in order to get us to pay attention. From
    the point of view of the SNS, positivity has no purpose for survival, so it does
    not merit our attention in the same way as a threat. This is why most news is
    focused on the negative and not the positive.

    into ourselves as a species, negative self-commentary became classified by the
    mind in the same way as actual dangers. Therefore, due to what is essentially
    a glitch in our filing system, our negative commentary sticks to us and stands
    out disproportionately in the mind. As our intelligence as a species increased,
    the negativity bias hijacked our thinking mind, and then we started making comparisons
    and connections that are not really valid. If we tell ourselves “I cannot do this,”
    or “I am afraid of that,” or “Gosh, if I do this, there will be this and this
    and this consequence,” these are protective attitudes in some ways. But then you
    take it to the next level, which is “Well, I cannot do anything. I am not really

    are coming from, it is easy to keep falling back into their trap because the mind
    and body naturally return to experiences related to childhood, for better or worse.
    The early experiences of comfort and safety—or their absence—that occurred when
    we were children set the stage for how we interact with the world as an adult,
    and they exercise a powerful gravitational pull on our consciousness, whether
    we are aware of them or not. The simplest evocative cue or sensory input associated
    with a traumatic experience can throw us back into the whirlpool of unresolved
    early emotions. Research has shown that only the upper levels of the brain are
    able to tell time, while the brain stem, which controls functions like body temperature
    and heart rate, contains no networks capable of processing the passage of time.
    What this means in practice is that when trauma is activated in our body and our
    consciousness shrinks down to its bare survival program, we have no way of knowing
    that the feelings will not last forever—we experience them as almost eternal,
    the way an infant would. Because they are tied to our instincts for survival,

    salary had been about 80 rupees, or ten dollars, a month at that time, and the
    money she was giving to make sure Shankar had a proper healthy breakfast was a
    significant percentage of her monthly income.

    Shankar found himself crying tears of gratitude for her selfless generosity. This
    was a profound lesson that allowed him to break the grip of his core belief of
    inadequacy and scarcity and to begin offering workshops on technological and emotional
    learning to underserved and remote communities around the world. When he became
    free from the limiting beliefs conditioned in his mind by his early environment,
    Shankar was able to focus fully on his earliest intention to offer his gifts in
    service of young people who feel overlooked and forgotten, allowing them to realize
    their potential.

    hours trekking through unfamiliar terrain trying to reunite with them. The landscape

    the Seven Summits, the highest mountains on each of the seven traditional continents.
    It was 2015, and Puncak Jaya was the fifth summit Silvia had climbed, having undertaken

    for Silvia. Growing up in Lima, Peru, Silvia was a victim of childhood sexual
    abuse. The trauma of her abuse and her family’s silence around it left deep emotional
    and psychic wounds. In her twenties, the pain led her into a spiral of serious
    depression, alcoholism, and broken relationships with women that held her life
    captive as she concealed her sexuality from her family. Even though she achieved
    success amidst the male-dominated posturing of the high-tech Silicon Valley world,
    she knew the untended wounds of her past were threatening to swallow her up. Finally,
    out of desperation, she accepted her mother’s invitation in 2005 to return to
    Peru to participate in an ayahuasca ceremony during which she had a transformative
    vision: her younger self appeared to her and called to her to walk together in
    a valley surrounded by mountains. This experience of illumination and reconnection
    was the start of a newfound sense of purpose. Silvia would heal herself by climbing
    the great mountains of the planet. In 2014, she had even started a nonprofit,
    Courageous Girls, whose purpose was to empower other young survivors of sexual
    abuse through climbing.'

    intrepid mountaineers to ascend the limestone faces of Puncak Jaya. The plan was
    to travel by helicopter to the base of the mountain, climb it, then trek back
    through the jungle over seven or eight days, accompanied by members of the Indigenous
    tribe living at the base of the mountain. The men from the tribe served as porters
    for the individual and kitchen tents and the women set up the camp and prepared
    the food. Living in this way in this remote environment, the Indigenous people
    remained connected to their ancestors through traditions from millennia before,
    practicing pig husbandry and sweet potato cultivation. The men still walked almost
    naked and many of the women trekked the entire way barefoot.

    the next goal, to achieve the next memorable experience, while forgetting about
    the human connection. Tired out by the climb and nursing sore feet in her muddy
    hiking boots that were wrong for the terrain, Silvia was slow to get started and
    the others left her behind with an assistant guide. Silvia was meant to be right
    behind her team, but when she and the guide set out, they could not find the group’s
    trail. They hiked and doubled back and scoured the virtually trackless landscape
    for clues but could find nothing. It was as if the others had just vanished. They

    approached and cast the light of the headlamp over it. A cigarette butt! This
    little scrap of litter, so unnoticeable in daily life and so out of place among
    the strange trees of the jungle, was finally a sign they were on the right track.
    They could expect another butt five meters away and follow it like a trail of
    breadcrumbs. This was the central point they had been lacking. With renewed hope,

    care for our wounds of the heart, we become empowered to teach our salience network
    what is important to us. We learn to hold our inner compass clearly and constantly
    in our minds. When we are fully free to visualize and rehearse our dreams, the
    power of our imagination lets us live in them in the present, and this enables
    us to be in frequent contact with the elevated positive emotions we need to teach
    our subconscious to pursue the goals and dreams we envision for our lives.
