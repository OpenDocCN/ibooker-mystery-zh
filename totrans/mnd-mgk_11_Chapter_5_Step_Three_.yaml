    for a mile or two until they met the street the public library was on. The gravel
    crunched under our sneakers as the Southern California heat haze shimmered above
    the steel tracks. Grateful for the air conditioning in the library, we lingered
    among the shelves, then finally we would check out the maximum of ten books each
    and carry them in our arms all the way back along the tracks to read in the bedroom
    we shared. Although each of us was on our own mostly private journey (my brother
    was discovering his talent as a visual artist and exploring his identity as a
    gay teen), I was still grateful for the way the ritual gave us time to be together,
    and I remember the pleasure I felt walking slightly behind him on the tracks,
    our arms weighed down by our latest treasures.

    of transcendence from the limited and painful environment I was living in. Without
    a wise guide to rein me in, I began experimenting with the practices of “soul
    travel” and out-of-body experiences. One night, I lay on my bed, did a breathing
    practice, and attempted to travel with my soul to other planes of reality. At
    first, nothing happened. Then, with a mixture of delight and uneasiness, I sensed
    my awareness as it rose up out of my body. My consciousness floated to the windowsill
    above the battalion of green plastic G.I. Joes and passed through the window and
    up into the branches of the tree outside, where I could sit and look back down
    on my own body resting in the bedroom. The sensation of being in two places at
    once, of experiencing two selves at once, was scary but also exhilarating, and
    seemed to offer a pathway to the freedom and independence I craved. It would have
    thrilled me to know that sixteen years later, the CIA would produce an official
    report on the application of such experiences that predicted teams of agents going
    out-of-body together and sending their detached consciousnesses across the world
    to spy on top-secret Soviet military projects in the name of national security.

    were different levels of existence through what some people call “astral projection.”
    I kept my journeys secret from everyone including my brother, so I had no teacher
    or mentor to guide me or advise me to slow down. Now, instead of stopping at the
    tree outside my window or a physical landmark on earth, I exited my body and rose
    through the atmosphere until I was so high, I could no longer see my body back
    in my bedroom. The first stage was total blackness and, no longer aware of the
    world below, I realized I could move within the blackness and travel to other,
    further places. I visited levels completely shrouded in fog and began to notice
    that in some places I felt an incredible sense of love and connection, and in
    others it was quite the opposite—I had a sense of the presence of various threatening
    and malevolent spirits floating out there. It was as if I were moving through
    a room filled with dense smoke, where I couldn’t see any forms but could feel
    their evil presence as they drew closer to me.

    terrifying. I would wake up and feel as if I were paralyzed, with a tightness
    in my chest that made it hard to breathe and full of a great fear that my soul
    was going to be taken over by one of these spirits. Sometimes I would cry out
    in terror and wake my brother, but he assumed I was just having a nightmare. Today
    you could argue that I was having what is known as a *hypnagogic hallucination*,
    a fleeting perceptual experience that occurs during the transition from wakefulness
    to sleep, when awareness of the environment drops away but brain stem activity
    continues. What I didn’t know at the time was that these experiences were giving
    me my first lesson in consciously working with my amygdala, the part of the limbic
    system in the brain that is responsible for regulating emotions such as fear and
    anxiety, and that the amygdala is the first gatekeeper in the brain when it comes

    approached, I was actually having a moment of recognizing my “shadow” self, as
    Jung would say. I could choose between resistance and acceptance. In that moment,
    the evil presence within the smoke-filled room that had terrified me simply came
    into me, and I absorbed it and no longer feared it. Once I no longer resisted,
    I no longer felt fear, which then allowed me to integrate it into myself and gave
    me the insight that, while it was part of me, I did not have to allow it to be

- en: Today I understand this experience as a key to my entire practice of manifesting
    because I began learning how to work with the amygdala. With practice, we can
    learn to accept that the amygdala will accompany us on our journeys, doing its
    job of trying to protect and care for our physical survival, but we do not need
    to let it make our decisions for us. Specifically, we do not let it choose where
    we direct our attention. As we will see in the following chapters, the practice
    of manifestation rests on our ability to direct our attention toward the objects
    of our intention (selective attention) and away from objects and experiences that
    distract it. Consciously directing our attention where we choose is the key to
    our inner power. The more skill we develop in learning to watch our experience
    without becoming emotionally activated, the more skill we have in placing and
    keeping our attention on the things we want to manifest.

- en: When we resist events, whether physical or emotional, our resistance stimulates
    the amygdala. The amygdala is very involved in our salience network (SN), a collection
    of regions in the brain that decide which stimuli deserve our attention. The SN
    is constantly filtering the information coming through our senses and making rapid-fire
    judgments about what is most important to process and respond to. As part of the
    limbic system, the amygdala has the power to immediately reroute all our cognitive
    resources to focus exclusively on physical survival. The more fear we bring to
    an event, the more we are telling the amygdala that the salience of the event
    is very high and very threatening; and the less fear we bring, the less we are
    going to activate the threat salience, leaving our attention free to be directed
    as we choose.

    SNS. It is based primarily in our brain stem, is the oldest part of our brain,

    its job was to keep us alive in our original niche environment. As a result, it
    is the very thing that has been associated with our survival as a species, and

    our success as organic life, the SNS remains with us today as a prevalent force
    within our subconscious directing actions it believes are beneficial to our survival.
    In other words, evolution typically does not discard, it includes. While the attributes
    of the SNS served a purpose when our species lived on the savanna in Africa, in
    modern society it results for many in a negative ongoing dialogue in their head.

  zh: 内心批评者的力量在我们重新审视交感神经系统（SNS）的角色时变得清晰。它主要位于我们的脑干，是我们大脑中最古老的部分，并且在我们的人类祖先中存在了数百万年。基本上，它的工作是让我们在最初的生态环境中生存。因此，它与我们作为一个物种的生存密切相关，这也是它为何如此深深扎根于我们之中的原因。作为我们有机生命成功的古老钥匙，SNS至今仍是我们潜意识中一种普遍存在的力量，指引着它认为对我们生存有益的行为。换句话说，进化通常不会舍弃，而是纳入。虽然SNS的特征在我们物种生活于非洲草原时发挥了作用，但在现代社会中，它对许多人来说却导致了头脑中持续的负面对话。从某种意义上说，消极是我们物种的第一语言，我们必须慢慢地、艰难地学习说一种新的语言。
- en: The problem is, where the SNS once protected our bodies from immediate physical
    dangers, it has followed us into our modern world and now tries to protect our
    sense of *self* from the countless small assaults of our interconnected reality.
    Where the fight response may once have helped us defend ourselves against a marauding
    tiger, it now causes us to fight against the parts of ourselves that we believe
    do not measure up, triggering overpowering emotions of shame and the feeling that
    we are not good enough. The volume of the inner critic and its sense of *relational*
    threat (“What will people think? Who do you think you are?”) is now deployed in
    a chronic maladaptation; it has undergone the unfortunate metamorphosis into the
    inner critic we know all too well today. Particularly tricky for us as manifesters
    is the *negativity bias*, a system of value tagging that makes warnings of danger
    stand out in our minds as most salient in order to get us to pay attention. From
    the point of view of the SNS, positivity has no purpose for survival, so it does
    not merit our attention in the same way as a threat. This is why most news is

    a glitch in our filing system, our negative commentary sticks to us and stands
    out disproportionately in the mind. As our intelligence as a species increased,
    the negativity bias hijacked our thinking mind, and then we started making comparisons
    and connections that are not really valid. If we tell ourselves “I cannot do this,”
    or “I am afraid of that,” or “Gosh, if I do this, there will be this and this

    we are so impressionable in our early developmental stages that we imprint the
    emotional content into our mind as permanent learning. The glue is the fight,
    flight, or freeze system’s exaggerated attention to negative stimuli, and so we
    emotionally code these messages we believe are essential to our physical survival.
    These sticky notes, often only accidents of our experience, start to become the
    basis for deeply rooted habit patterns carved into our neurons, which in turn
    become the architecture of our sense of self.

- en: If we are unable to identify and understand where our primal negative feelings
    are coming from, it is easy to keep falling back into their trap because the mind
    and body naturally return to experiences related to childhood, for better or worse.
    The early experiences of comfort and safety—or their absence—that occurred when
    we were children set the stage for how we interact with the world as an adult,
    and they exercise a powerful gravitational pull on our consciousness, whether
    we are aware of them or not. The simplest evocative cue or sensory input associated
    with a traumatic experience can throw us back into the whirlpool of unresolved
    early emotions. Research has shown that only the upper levels of the brain are
    able to tell time, while the brain stem, which controls functions like body temperature
    and heart rate, contains no networks capable of processing the passage of time.
    What this means in practice is that when trauma is activated in our body and our
    consciousness shrinks down to its bare survival program, we have no way of knowing
    that the feelings will not last forever—we experience them as almost eternal,
    the way an infant would. Because they are tied to our instincts for survival,
    they can cause us to act from our primal nature, sometimes in ways that are violent

    major adaptations was the evolution of the dorsolateral vagal nerve, a large part
    of the vagus nerve that links the internal organs with the central control systems
    in the brain and is the basis for the rest-and-digest response. This adaptation
    made it possible for mammalian parents to offer the significant post-birth care

    depression, alcoholism, and broken relationships with women that held her life
    captive as she concealed her sexuality from her family. Even though she achieved
    success amidst the male-dominated posturing of the high-tech Silicon Valley world,
    she knew the untended wounds of her past were threatening to swallow her up. Finally,
    out of desperation, she accepted her mother’s invitation in 2005 to return to
    Peru to participate in an ayahuasca ceremony during which she had a transformative
    vision: her younger self appeared to her and called to her to walk together in
    a valley surrounded by mountains. This experience of illumination and reconnection

    tribe living at the base of the mountain. The men from the tribe served as porters

  zh: 回忆一下安全的感觉。对许多人来说，这会唤起母亲或挚爱之人抱住他们的画面。你也可以想象自己处于一个特别安全的地方，比如你曾经去过的一个僻静的小溪，或者坐在温暖的家庭晚餐桌旁。无论是什么让你感到被保护。
- en: Whether safety means being in a relationship or in solitude for you, the effect
    will be the same. Remember, though, that solitude is different from loneliness.
    Stay with this feeling of safety and do not be concerned with anything beyond
    those feelings.
