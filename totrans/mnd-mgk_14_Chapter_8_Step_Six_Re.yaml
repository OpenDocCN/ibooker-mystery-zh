    forming the Pachamama Alliance while she was still working as an executive for
    the Hunger Project. She was flying all over the world addressing issues of hunger
    and poverty in sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian subcontinent, was responsible
    for operations in over fifty-three countries, and was also raising three kids.
    This work was the result of her childhood visions of meeting Mother Teresa and
    joining her ministry, which at the time Lynne believed to be her highest calling
    in life. She was very busy and her time was stretched, but she agreed to take
    a short leave to travel to Guatemala to help a close friend co-lead a trip of
    donors. During the trip, Lynne had an extraordinary experience, led by a shaman
    in the mountains, which resulted in a series of visions of Indigenous people with
    orange geometric face paint and feather crowns appearing to her at all hours,
    almost haunting her. She discovered she was being called to change her life path
    dramatically and devote her energies to the project of protecting the Sacred Headwaters
    and its Indigenous people.

    of letting go of our expectations. One of the pitfalls we can easily fall into
    when we are manifesting is to become overly attached to the outcome of our actions.
    Attachment to outcome, and the suffering that arises when we are overly attached,
    takes many forms. We may be attached to a particular timeline, a particular “how,”
    or a particular goal only to discover along the way that life has something different
    in store for us that we never imagined. In each case, if we remain attached to
    our preconception of how the outcome should happen, rather than responding to
    what is changing and evolving and alive for us in the present, we close off possibilities
    rather than finding our way by living through the experience. If we persist in
    our grasping at one particular outcome, we are likely to suffer rope burn, and
    we must practice letting go.

- en: This is indeed a subtle practice, because part of the power of the manifesting
    techniques is to ground our intention in highly specific and emotionally coded
    visualizations. However, we have to remember that the high level of detail in
    our visualizations is for classifying our intention as important within the subconscious,
    not for actually exerting influence on our external world. In other words, holding
    a powerfully imagined and emotionally resonant vision of our intention in our
    minds allows our subconscious to guide our activity, but the results of that activity
    come from the world around us and what it needs. Frequently, we cannot see far
    enough ahead to know all the twists and turns of the journey. But if we are willing
    to attend carefully to the feedback that comes from our environment and the people
    around us as we pursue our goal, we often discover our inner compass has already
    plotted the next step on our course, whether we expected it or not. The reality
    is that we rarely need to know exactly how our intention will be realized or how
    we will reach our destination. We only need to look for the next right step.

    our intention as even more important and to redouble its efforts at realizing
    it. When, on the other hand, our actions result in frustration, confusion, or
    even harm to ourselves or others, we can pause to take stock of whether our intention

    alleviating it.” When we are able to get there in our minds, that allows us to
    come back inside ourselves with a more positive and wholesome view of ourselves
    and our possibilities. A kind of inner jujitsu takes place: we have to leave ourselves,
    through service to others, in order to see the world in a different way, and then
    by watching how people change through our service, we change and can reflect back
    on the inner critic and how it limits us. There is a dynamic rhythm to the process,

    and stretch, forming around the shape of my hand. In just this way, manifesting

    I practice opening my heart and forgiving myself. Like you, I am only a human

    Tulane University’s “White Coat Ceremony.” I wanted to leave the students with
    something they could always carry with them, something that would always be there
    to open their hearts. As a result, I began revisiting the conversations I’d had
    with Ruth. This led me to create a mnemonic containing ten letters of the alphabet.
    Where I had once made a list of my material goals, I now made a new list of the
    ten things that open the heart: Compassion, Dignity, Equanimity, Forgiveness,
    Gratitude, Humility, Integrity, Justice, Kindness, and Love (CDEFGHIJKL). For
    me they are an aid to remembering the core values of my life. As I described in
    *Into the Magic Shop*, I call it the *alphabet of the heart*. I start every day
    sitting at the side of my bed slowly breathing in and releasing my breath, over
    and over, and then I think of the joy and awe of being in this incredible world.
    Once I sit with that for a few minutes, I go through the alphabet of my heart
    letter by letter, and that sets the tone of my day. When I get frustrated or overwhelmed,
    I stop, breathe, and then focus on one of the letters and what it means, and it
    calms me down and resets my intention. Two of these words will serve us particularly
    well at this point in the journey: gratitude and equanimity.'

    their brains three months after the letter writing started, indicating that the

    look out for gratitude down the line and experience it more readily when an opportunity
    to feel it happened again. In practice, this also means the brain is being trained
    to turn attention away from painful emotions such as resentment or envy, increasing
    the difficulty of ruminating on what didn’t work out. The lasting sensitization
    that gratitude offers has wide-ranging benefits, including psychological protection.

    chasing a dream, we might lose sight of the ones who quietly support us on the
    path. When we open to magic, it may involve seeing what is familiar in a new light.
    Gratitude is a very powerful practice because it requires us to see how we’ve
    been supported and affirmed by others. One researcher considers the social dimension
    of gratitude to be especially important and calls it a “relationship-strengthening
    emotion.” Some studies even link the origin of gratitude among our primate ancestors

    philosophical tradition that includes wabi-sabi, the practice of consciously valuing
