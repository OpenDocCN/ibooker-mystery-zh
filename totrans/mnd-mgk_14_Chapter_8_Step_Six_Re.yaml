- en: Lynne Twist, founder of the Soul of Money Institute, received her vision for
    forming the Pachamama Alliance while she was still working as an executive for
    the Hunger Project. She was flying all over the world addressing issues of hunger
    and poverty in sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian subcontinent, was responsible
    for operations in over fifty-three countries, and was also raising three kids.
    This work was the result of her childhood visions of meeting Mother Teresa and
    joining her ministry, which at the time Lynne believed to be her highest calling
    in life. She was very busy and her time was stretched, but she agreed to take
    a short leave to travel to Guatemala to help a close friend co-lead a trip of
    donors. During the trip, Lynne had an extraordinary experience, led by a shaman
    in the mountains, which resulted in a series of visions of Indigenous people with
    orange geometric face paint and feather crowns appearing to her at all hours,
    almost haunting her. She discovered she was being called to change her life path
    dramatically and devote her energies to the project of protecting the Sacred Headwaters
    and its Indigenous people.

    conflict about the Hunger Project, where she had huge responsibilities and a lot
    of passion and commitment. She did not know how to get out of her obligations
    to the Hunger Project and change course, but was haunted day and night by the
    faces calling her to the Amazon. Then she received a gift.

    of letting go of our expectations. One of the pitfalls we can easily fall into
    when we are manifesting is to become overly attached to the outcome of our actions.
    Attachment to outcome, and the suffering that arises when we are overly attached,
    takes many forms. We may be attached to a particular timeline, a particular “how,”
    or a particular goal only to discover along the way that life has something different
    in store for us that we never imagined. In each case, if we remain attached to
    our preconception of how the outcome should happen, rather than responding to
    what is changing and evolving and alive for us in the present, we close off possibilities
    rather than finding our way by living through the experience. If we persist in
    our grasping at one particular outcome, we are likely to suffer rope burn, and
    we must practice letting go.

- en: This is indeed a subtle practice, because part of the power of the manifesting
    techniques is to ground our intention in highly specific and emotionally coded
    visualizations. However, we have to remember that the high level of detail in
    our visualizations is for classifying our intention as important within the subconscious,
    not for actually exerting influence on our external world. In other words, holding
    a powerfully imagined and emotionally resonant vision of our intention in our
    minds allows our subconscious to guide our activity, but the results of that activity
    come from the world around us and what it needs. Frequently, we cannot see far
    enough ahead to know all the twists and turns of the journey. But if we are willing
    to attend carefully to the feedback that comes from our environment and the people
    around us as we pursue our goal, we often discover our inner compass has already
    plotted the next step on our course, whether we expected it or not. The reality
    is that we rarely need to know exactly how our intention will be realized or how
    we will reach our destination. We only need to look for the next right step.

    speech and actions and seeing what comes back, we create a feedback loop that
    helps us get in closer touch with our inner compass. When our actions create positive
    results accompanied by positive emotions, our salience network learns to classify
    our intention as even more important and to redouble its efforts at realizing
    it. When, on the other hand, our actions result in frustration, confusion, or
    even harm to ourselves or others, we can pause to take stock of whether our intention

    When we are buying into the negativity of the inner critic inside our minds, we

    help others. In the process, we discover, “Oh yes, I’m not the only one suffering,

    alleviating it.” When we are able to get there in our minds, that allows us to
    come back inside ourselves with a more positive and wholesome view of ourselves
    and our possibilities. A kind of inner jujitsu takes place: we have to leave ourselves,
    through service to others, in order to see the world in a different way, and then
    by watching how people change through our service, we change and can reflect back

    not happen at all, some happen partially, some happen but only after a long period
    of time has passed. When everything is riding on a single result, we can’t help
    but put tremendous pressure on ourselves to make it happen, and it’s hard not
    to become tightly attached to the desired outcome. It is important to remember
    that attachment to results is just another form of fear, and as we have seen in
    previous chapters, fear is the emotion that most interferes with our agency. When
    we recognize that we are clinging too tightly to an outcome, we can use relaxation
    practices to bring ourselves back into balance. When we acknowledge and work with
    our fear, we can access the natural patience and equanimity that come from being
    on the right track. This patience is an integral part of the acceptance that separates
    us from attachment, which is a root cause of suffering for so many.

    ten things that open the heart: Compassion, Dignity, Equanimity, Forgiveness,

    the finding suggests that practicing gratitude had sensitized their brains to
    look out for gratitude down the line and experience it more readily when an opportunity
    to feel it happened again. In practice, this also means the brain is being trained
    to turn attention away from painful emotions such as resentment or envy, increasing
    the difficulty of ruminating on what didn’t work out. The lasting sensitization
    that gratitude offers has wide-ranging benefits, including psychological protection.
    Another study found that among adolescents, feelings of gratitude show an inverse

    chasing a dream, we might lose sight of the ones who quietly support us on the
    path. When we open to magic, it may involve seeing what is familiar in a new light.
    Gratitude is a very powerful practice because it requires us to see how we’ve
    been supported and affirmed by others. One researcher considers the social dimension
    of gratitude to be especially important and calls it a “relationship-strengthening

    of both the good and the bad that occur in our lives, whether we get what we want,
    don’t get what we want, or get what we do not want. Equanimity is the quality
    of the mind that lets us be even minded in our reactions toward all experiences
    or objects, whether they are pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral. In terms of neuroscience,
    equanimity is associated with a critical change in relation to how we perceive
    and interpret our own experience. In practice, equanimity is what allows us to
    pursue our intentions without being the victim of every single tiny vacillation
    in how things are going. We let experience unfold and do not become overly caught
    up in our expectations.

    it is wonderful to bask in the glory of accomplishment and have dopamine coursing
    from our reward centers, that feeling cannot last, and for many this leads to
    disappointment. Attachment to a positive outcome also leads to not being present
    as you repeatedly focus on accomplishing a goal to get another reward and feel
    good again. The flip side is that life naturally contains disappointments, and
    when we become fixated on our perceived failures, rumination reinforces feelings
    of discouragement and can lead to depression and further suffering.

    feelings while understanding that those feelings are transitory. Just as for most
    of us the feelings that arise when we are disappointed or feel we have failed
    are transitory as well. Therefore, having an evenness of temperament is critically
    important. Equanimity is the embodiment of balance and nonreactivity, and it allows
    us our freedom. It is freedom from attachment that releases the magic within us.

    we consider negative triggers a domino effect of secondary reactions: we want
    to push the negative away or reach tightly to grasp something more positive. The
    problem is that these secondary reactions cause more reactions like themselves,
    which in turn provide the basis for further suffering, which in turn—you can see
    where this is going. But it turns out that if we consciously block the secondary
    reactions, we can avoid the entire cascading activation.'

    and intensity of unpleasant experiences compared with novice practitioners. Neuroimaging
    revealed that the reduction in the unpleasantness of pain while in a meditative
    state was accompanied by increased brain activation in sensory areas (the posterior
    insula/secondary somatosensory cortex) and decreased activation in an area associated
    with executive control (the lateral prefrontal cortex). What this suggests is
    that the experienced meditators weren’t resisting the pain as the novices were,
    and therefore, the pain was significantly less unpleasant for them.

    were explicitly told *not* to meditate while experiencing pain from heat stimulation.
    The experienced practitioners had less sensitivity to the pain while experiencing
    greater activation in the brain regions that primarily process pain. What this
    means is that they were feeling their experience more deeply on a sensory level
    but resisting it with their minds much less. We can see equanimity as the practice
    of balancing and rebalancing physiological and emotional responses to events that
    cause us stress: those with an even-minded attitude toward uncomfortable experiences
    are able to recover more quickly afterward and regain homeostasis.'

    focus on our task fully, then helps us let go of our attachment to the result.
    It is the stance toward life that enables us to feel our experiences fully and
    with an open heart but take a lighter and more accepting attitude when things
    do not go our way. And, most importantly, it increases our access to self-forgiveness
    and gives us the broad perspective to reframe our so-called mistakes as inevitable
    snags that teach us to do it differently the next time.

- en: There’s a story from fifteenth-century Japan about the shogun, or military ruler,
    Ashikaga Yoshimasa, who had a set of ceramic bowls from China for use in the formal
    tea ceremony. When one of the bowls was damaged, the shogun sent it back to China
    to be repaired. The bowl came back with ugly metal staples suturing the crack
    together, like a poorly closed wound after a shoddy surgery. Disappointed, the
    shogun recruited a local craftsman to come up with a more aesthetically pleasing
    method to repair the precious bowls. According to this legend, the craftsman drew
    on the long-standing practice of using lacquer, a natural resin made from tree
    sap, to rejoin broken ceramics but transformed the appearance of the seam by sprinkling
    gold dust into the lacquer. This was the origin of the technique of kintsugi,
    or “golden joinery.” Rather than attempting to hide the previous damage, kintsugi
    not only accepts the crack but highlights it, allowing us to appreciate the history
    of the object as part of its beauty. What may have ended up in the garbage has
    been transmuted into a stronger and more unique work of art.

- en: Whether this legend is true or not, kintsugi contains a profound teaching on
    how to reframe our so-called mistakes, as well as the inevitable knocks, breaks,
    and cracks that come with living an engaged life. Kintsugi is part of a Japanese
    philosophical tradition that includes wabi-sabi, the practice of consciously valuing
    marks of wear from an object’s use in order to embrace what is flawed and imperfect.
    At the core of wabi-sabi is the humble understanding and realization that we are
    ourselves incomplete, impermanent, and limited by being bound in time. That is
    the nature of our existence, and its denial further creates suffering. When we
    accept this reality, it allows us to move forward without fear.

- en: 'Kintsugi embodies the recognition that the nature of life results at times
    in us being broken, but it is the very nature of this brokenness and the repair
    that defines who we are. These scars define our humanity: every one of us is a
    frail, fragile human being who is struggling in some way and feels that no one
    else is struggling as they are. And yet, we can be proud of our scars and not
    feel insufficient or ashamed and try to hide them. They are living proof of our
    resilience written on our bodies and hearts. When we relax with our imperfections,
    we invite others to acknowledge their own scars and come out of hiding to connect
    with one another. This is the power of us accepting and letting go, and it is
    a superpower that is contained in each of us. In a sense, we can practice gratitude
    to our scars for allowing us the opportunity to see our full potential—the scar
    is what brings out the gold. The awareness I gained from getting everything I
    thought I wanted and losing it has become a kind of gold thread shining through
    my life that allows me to appreciate where I am today.'

    it away, we can instead practice acceptance that leading a life of seamless perfection
    is neither realistic nor compassionate. Acceptance means taking one foot and putting
    it in front of the other, and slowly going forward into the unknown. By being
    willing to forgive myself for all the things I cannot control, as well as for
    my own mistakes along the way, I take away the power that fear and anger have
    over my mind, and I allow the inner compass of my heart again to be my guide,
    trusting I will be led exactly where I need to go.
