- en: '[*](18_Chapter_Nine_The_Luck.xhtml#footnote-022-backlink) Archimedes was trying
    to figure out how to assess the purity of gold. He settled himself into a tub
    and realized that the water displacement equaled the volume of his body (or the
    part submerged). He jumped out of the tub, shouted, “Eureka!” and ran home naked.
    The story was first told two centuries after it supposedly occurred—casting some
    doubt on its veracity. But we refuse to stop believing in that tale.'
