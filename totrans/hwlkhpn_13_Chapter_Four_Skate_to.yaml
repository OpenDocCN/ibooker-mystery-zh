    come to our weekly Wednesday get-togethers full of new ideas and theories. The
    first question when he came to New York was always where we would meet. I had
    one or two favorite spots in the city, but now the range of my hangouts expanded
    dramatically. A new restaurant in Columbus Circle, the Loeb Boathouse in Central
    Park, a coffee bar on the West Side—Barnaby was always looking for someplace better
    than where he’d been before.

    about five hours a day watching TV in one form or another, plus another two hours
    or so consuming media on their phones and tablets. Seven hours a day is pretty
    much a full-time job. But unless you’re prepping to be a judge on *Dancing with
    the Stars*, you’re not going to get lucky by sitting home and watching television.
    Luck comes from being in a place where you can take advantage of the unexpected.
    Your couch is not one of those spots.

    and true, because when the puck got to him, he was ready—and also often the only
    one there. You can score all sorts of (real and proverbial) goals by being in
    the right place for positive things to happen—whether you’re looking for a job,
    a spouse, or a sports trophy. I’d already learned that lucky events aren’t nearly
    as haphazard as they may appear. Being in the right place at the right time can
    be a matter of sheer chance, but just as often, some reasoned trajectory got you
    to that spot. If you’re trying to get lucky, you have to think about where you’re
    headed—and where the puck will be.

    who left her home country of South Africa after a string of bad events in an unusually
    dramatic childhood. Her mother shot and killed Theron’s alcoholic father in self-defense
    (there were no charges), and Theron moved to Italy and then America, looking for
    better luck. It didn’t happen immediately. She wanted to be a dancer, but her
    knees gave out. She was so depressed that her mother told her to come back home,
    but at age nineteen, she went to Los Angeles to give herself one last chance.
    It wasn’t looking good—until she had a screaming fit in a bank when a teller refused
    to cash the check her mom had sent from South Africa.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now I’m not suggesting that exploding in rage is the way to get lucky. But by
    dragging herself to Los Angeles after all that had gone wrong, Theron put herself
    in a place where opportunities were most likely to happen. If she’d given up and
    gone back to South Africa, everyone at home would have understood and consoled
    her on her hard luck. Instead, she gave herself the chance to get lucky—and the
    2004 Academy Award for Best Actress ended up on her mantel rather than someone
    else’s.

    making big moves like Theron did is unusual here. According to an analysis in
    *The* *New York Times*, a scant 20 percent of Americans live more than a couple
    of hours’ drive away from their moms, and half of all grown-ups in the country
    stay within eighteen miles of those moms.[*](37_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1) I am
    a great fan of mothers, but they are not necessarily the source of all luck. Moving
    away from Mom can lead to new connections and better possibilities.

    You can move to Los Angeles planning to audition for commercials, but instead
    you throw a tantrum in a bank, get an agent, take acting classes, and end up playing
    a serious role that wins you an Oscar. Each of those events (the tantrum in the
    bank, getting an agent . . .) could have numerous different outcomes, and one
    doesn’t lead inexorably to the next. You have to see the possibility and grab
    it.

    opportunities would be. The Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis didn’t start
    out lucky—his family lost everything during the Greco-Turkish War, and he fled
    to Buenos Aires as a teenager. But even when Onassis was too broke to eat out,
    he would go to the most expensive hotel and order tea.

    so that he could listen in on other people’s business calls and figure out his
    own angles. He always put himself in a place where he could meet the people who
    would help him. It’s probably excessive to say that this rule led him to be one
    of the richest men in the world, the lover of opera diva Maria Callas, and the
    husband to widowed Jacqueline Kennedy. But the determined effort to make his own
    luck certainly helped him rebound, and his go-for-it principles still resonate.

- en: I probably wouldn’t use my last dime for tea in a fancy hotel, but maybe that’s
    why I’m not as rich as Onassis. To get lucky, you have to be in a place where
    you can make opportunities. It’s always easy to find reasons and excuses not to
    do something, and a defeatist attitude can sometimes even seem like the rational
    one. Maybe it is. But it’s not the one that will make you lucky.

    money for her charities on a first-class flight from India to London than almost
    any other place.”

    Teresa lived in India and dedicated her life to the people she described as the
    unwanted, unloved, and uncared for in society. She started a congregation called
    the Missionaries of Charity, which expanded rapidly over the years, and by the
    time she died in 1997, it included thousands of nuns in more than a hundred countries,
    all of them vowing to give “wholehearted free service to the poorest of the poor.”

    of the poor and forgotten—and she was intent on gathering charitable donations.
    Though she believed that understanding the poor meant living among them, she often
    flew in the first-class cabin of airplanes. She got some criticism for that, but
    being in the front of the plane on her frequent travels ultimately brought luck
    that she could spread far. Talking to people on long flights from India to London
    (and elsewhere) gave her a captive fund-raising audience and generated some of
    her biggest contributions. She understood that the executive who could afford
    seat 1A was probably more able to contribute generously to her cause than the
    guy in the middle seat of the last row in economy. In person, this small and intent
    woman was hard to turn down. Her passion was her power.

    Calcutta. The canonization caused some controversy (though it didn’t mention her
    travel arrangements), and even in her down-to-earth days, critics sometimes pointed
    out her many connections with dubious (albeit rich) executives and dictators.
    More positively, she did whatever was necessary to help fund her important activities
    and bring some luck to the neediest. Sometimes she found the people who could
    help in India and sometimes at international meetings and sometimes just walking
    to the bathroom in the first-class section of the airplane. She went where the
    donors would be.

    Leads to Another.” Fans were probably more interested in the hot dance beat than
    the philosophical reasoning behind the words, but the title also hits on a simple
    truth—because in life and luck, one thing *does* lead to another. You set the
    stage for one positive result and others will follow from it—and often the luck
    gets bigger and bigger. As the writer E. B. White charmingly put it, “There’s
    no limit to how complicated things can get, on account of one thing always leading

    that luck feeds luck. When Mark Zuckerberg was a Harvard undergraduate and started
    Facebook, he moved to Palo Alto for a summer to give his company the best chance
    of being lucky. He went where the luck would be. In that tech-focused environment,
    one thing definitely led to another—because one person led to another. Zuckerberg
    hired Sean Parker (who had started Napster) to be president of his budding company.
    Looking for investments, Parker went to Reid Hoffman, who headed the social networking
    site LinkedIn. Hoffman liked the idea but couldn’t invest (he thought it was a
    conflict of interest), so he introduced Parker to Peter Thiel, whom he had worked
    with at PayPal—and Zuckerberg got his first $500,000 angel investment.[*](38_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_2)
    Zuckerberg profited (hugely, as it turned out) by being in a place where luck
    and support could flow his way. For Zuckerberg and Facebook, the luck happened
    when one person led to another—Parker to Hoffman to Thiel.

    biologists have noticed this in the natural world for a long time and call it
    “ideal free distribution”—noting that more animals gather in the spots richest
    in resources. For a squirrel, a grassy area with lots of nuts and fruits scattered
    on the ground might seem like the perfect place to hang out. But if all the other
    squirrels are there too, and you’re on the small side and don’t have sharp claws,
    maybe you’re better off on the less fertile land down the road. You may not get

    show has gotten so popular that the producers get some forty thousand applications
