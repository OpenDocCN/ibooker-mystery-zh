    Africa. We stayed one night at a glorious hotel called Le Quartier Français and
    indulged in a nine-course dinner (yes, *nine* courses) in a famed restaurant called
    the Tasting Room. Over crazy good food, we held hands, stared moonily at each
    other, and talked about our amazing good luck. We still made each other laugh,
    shared the same sense of adventure (all those lions and rhinos in Africa!), and
    had been great partners in raising our two terrific sons.

    he had a kind, caring style that I admired. But, as I suspected after all the
    research I’d been doing, our luck in love had less to do with the magic of meeting
    the right person than with the effort we had put in afterward. Nicholas Sparks
    would never sell a book if he wrote about the nitty-gritty that makes a good marriage—turning
    the other cheek when one person is snitty and turning to the other side of the
    bed when the other person is snoring. But ultimately, those are the twists and
    turns that make others think it was all just good luck.

    to being lucky in love was to pay attention to the other person’s needs as much
    as to your own.

    in Love.” For the racy rock star with the wandering hips, the song was a fairly
    obvious way to boast about sexual conquest. He might be unlucky as a gambler with
    cards, horses, roulette, and craps, but he could crow that with women, it was
    easy. “Yes, I’ve got the winning touch,” he bellowed.

    with half a dozen different mothers and has managed to keep the sex-symbol moniker

    Soon after our trip to South Africa, I was on a book-tour stop in Iowa and met

    pushed into the background. Photographers wanted to get shots of Helen on the

    walked into a chic restaurant—but again, all eyes were on her, not him. He found

    at a friend’s wedding than among 20,000 fellow revelers at a football game. (If
    you want to connect to a potential partner, strike up a conversation over the
    dessert buffet rather than at the stadium hot dog stand.) Confidence, a positive
    mind-set, and an openness to possibility help make you lucky in love.

    get lucky when you pay attention to where you’ll find the best opportunities.
    And that means the best opportunities for *you*. Remember the idea Barnaby described
    earlier of ideal free distribution? Animals have a natural tendency to aggregate
    in certain areas where they’re most likely to find food and mates. In human terms,
    that’s called happy hour at a bar. They seem to know quite naturally where to
    gather relative to the resources available. If there’s an area of thick vegetation
    good for grazing, you’ll find lots of (say) deer there and fewer deer in the less-dense
    area across the field. That way there’s plenty for everybody. Once too many deer
    are gathered in the same place, some will (reasonably enough) drift to another
    spot. Once again, there’s enough for everyone.

    too. Think about what advantages you have and what your peers are doing—and then
    you can reasonably figure out how to make your own luck. You can go to the bar
    where all the coolest, richest, and sexiest people hang out, because that’s where
    you have the best chance of meeting a cool, rich, and sexy Mr. or Ms. Right. But
    if everyone else is gathering there, too, then you’re all competing for the same,
    well, resources. Where there is more opportunity, there is a greater density of
    competitors. If you’re the kind of person who can compete in that setting, then
    step right up and order a martini. But if you don’t stand out amid the noise,
    maybe you have a better chance of getting lucky (in meeting someone, that is)
    at the quieter coffee shop down the block.

    the same for everyone. If you want a very specific type of mate, demand and supply
    might not match. (Sorry, nothing is perfect.) To return to Barnaby’s animal analogy
    for a moment, some get lucky by grazing on grass and others by browsing on trees—and
    setting the right target sets you up for subsequent luck. If you don’t have the
    right target, you miss out on the luck.

    You think you have a rational approach, but then something changes (the Dow is
    down by 200!), and you panic and let the emotions of a moment change your plan.
    “To be lucky in love or the stock market, you don’t want to let your nature run
    the show,” he said.

    people. When you choose a stock, the stock doesn’t change. But the moment you
    choose a person, the relationship alters. “You make luck when you decide that
    you’re going to be here for a long time, so let’s explore and figure out what
    works,” said Dr. Ariely. “A relationship gets better when you invest in it. The
    commitment creates new opportunities.”

    with the exciting idea of investing. Put time and effort and trust and love into
    a person, and you get huge dividends. It occurred to me that Ron and I had followed
    that route—we were committed to each other and trusted the other one to hang around,
    no matter what. So we could explore and try things, cutting out the ones that
    didn’t work and continuing with what did. “If we’re going to be here for a long
    time, whatever I want for myself is also what I want for you,” Dr. Ariely said.
    “And that’s how you make luck. We can try out new things together and not worry
    that something won’t work.”

    abuse or violence or alcoholism or other damaging behavior where the only way
    to get lucky is to leave. But in more benign circumstances, Dr. Ariely points
    out that it’s not the choosing that matters so much as what you do once the choice
    is made.

    kick in to prove that we’ve made the best choice. In various popular experiments,
    researchers have given volunteers small items such as a mug or a pen, and once
    it was officially theirs, they could trade it. But few did. Just possessing it
    made them like it more. And the same held for partners. In one survey of 1,100
    people that Helen Fisher oversaw, 86 percent said that they would marry the same
    person over again.

    lease that both you and the landlord have to keep agreeing to renew. “If you’re
    deciding every day whether to extend the lease, you won’t paint or buy flowers.
    You’ll always be looking at other options,” he said.

    we wanted to leave our suburban home and move to Manhattan, I suggested that we
    rent a small apartment and try it out. If we liked city life, we would take the
    next step. Ron didn’t like the idea. He thought it would be a completely different
    experience if we bought a place and made it ours and felt committed.

    and then lovingly renovated it. I chose the paint colors and the bathroom fixtures
    and the new kitchen cabinets, and Ron made sure the wiring was as he wanted it
    and the outlets were in the right places and . . . well, something about coaxial
    cable. I didn’t have to understand everything. But the point is, after we invested
    our time and attention, we loved that little apartment way beyond reason.

    even if our conscious brains aren’t quite so smart. For the ABC-TV show *The Bachelor*,
    he set up experiments for the 2016 season, checking the brain activity of bachelor
    Ben and six of the women he was meeting. The tests looked at how they reacted
    to each other’s smells, the levels of oxytocin release, and physiological syncing—measured
    by heart rate variability and how closely their rhythms matched.

    machines and test tubes and beakers filled with colored liquids—a set decorator’s

    beakers. A bachelorette named Olivia emerged as the clear winner in all three
    tests—but Ben proposed to a woman named Lauren B. in the end. Dr. Zak is convinced
    the research has validity, though *The Bachelor* may have been the wrong venue
    for showing it off.

    making us lucky in love. The ancient poets who thought of the heart as the source
    of love weren’t completely wrong—our bodies send us love signals. Psychologists
    say that if you want somebody to get excited about you, do something scary with
    them on a first date—go rock climbing or midnight skiing, or take a spin on a
    roller coaster. The fancy name is “misattribution of arousal,” meaning your brain
    gets mixed up about what is causing you to feel exhilarated. If you’re on a roller
    coaster and screaming in excitement, your brain may attribute some of the thrill
    to the guy who’s sitting next to you. Adventures get you aroused and make you
    feel connected to the other person.

    our mantra ever since. There’s nothing that doesn’t get better for us with sex,
    a hike, or a museum. Those happen to be things Ron and I like, anyway, and any
    couple can find their own lucky activities. All the neurochemicals released when
    you’re doing something new (like a museum) or challenging (like a hike) help you
    bond. And sex does all of the above and more.

    are trade-offs. It may be that now that he is in his seventies, Mick Jagger wouldn’t
    mind having a little less sex and a little more attachment. The happily attached
    Phoebe may just read a lot of romance novels to fill that missing niche. You can’t
    have everything. But it helps to know that you don’t have to search endlessly
    to get lucky in love. You just have to create the lucky situation you want—and
    maybe take a ride on a roller coaster.
