- en: '[*](26_Chapter_Fifteen_How_t.xhtml#footnote-041-backlink) Each person is 90
    percent reliable, so if two people are coming, the odds of one of them being late
    is 90 percent times 90 percent, or an 81 percent likelihood. With another person,
    you multiply by 90 percent again. Once you keep multiplying, you’re okay through
    six people, and with the next person, you’re down to a 47 percent chance that
    they’ll all arrive on time—less than half. Get ready for the diner.'
