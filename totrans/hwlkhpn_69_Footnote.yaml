- en: '[*](25_Chapter_Fourteen_The_.xhtml#footnote-039-backlink) Doctors also get
    confused by these kind of statistical problems. In one study, doctors were told
    that the probability of breast cancer is 1 percent for a woman at age forty who
    participates in routine screening, and the cancer will be found 80 percent of
    the time. There is also a false positive rate of 9.6 percent. If a patient has
    a positive mammography, what’s the likelihood she has breast cancer? Most doctors
    said between 70 and 80 percent. If you play out the numbers as above, you see
    it’s under 8 percent. In screening 1,000 women, there would be 10 found who have
    cancer and 96 found who are false positive. Once again, think of those 101 people
    on the cruise ship, and you understand.'
