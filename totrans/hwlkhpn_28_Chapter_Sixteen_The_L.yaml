    all sorts of ways—success in your career, confidence with your kids, energy in
    your love life, and an ability to turn bad days into good ones. All that gives

    lucky pieces together, what do they add up to in the bigger sense?

- en: “It’s a little bit like baking,” Barnaby said. “You have the salt and the flour
    and the water, but how you blend them together makes all the difference. You can
    end up with a loaf of white bread or a fancy challah. You have to know which you
    prefer and what you’re trying to make.”

  zh: “有点像烘焙，”巴纳比说，“你有盐、面粉和水，但你如何将它们混合在一起才是关键。你可以做出一条白面包，也可以做出一块精美的哈拉面包。你得知道你喜欢什么，以及你想做什么。”
- en: Barnaby didn’t strike me as either a white bread or a challah guy—more like
    whole wheat with raisins and poppy seeds (or something equally unusual and interesting).
    But the point was fair enough. In luck and life, if you don’t know where you’re
    going, you’re probably not going to get there.

- en: A few years earlier, Barnaby was investigating the expansive topic of meaning
    and purpose in life, and he did a study of students on college campuses. He wanted
    to find out how college would help them reach their larger life goals. But he
    quickly realized that most of the students didn’t *have* larger life goals.

- en: “They lacked a bigger picture of what would matter to them in life,” Barnaby
    said. Students he met on campuses across the country spoke vaguely about their
    post-graduation future, but when he asked for specifics about the jobs they imagined,
    he got a lot of uncomfortable pauses and answers along the lines of “anything
    I can get” or “something that pays a lot.”[*](78_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1) The
    lack of clarity wasn’t just about their careers. Barnaby said he would have been
    happy if someone said he wanted to get married and have a house by the sea or
    hoped to return to his hometown and help his ailing parents. Anything that suggested
    a deeper reflection on life and ultimate goals.

- en: “It’s hard enough turning an aspiration to reality when you *have* an aspiration.

    in our survey about elements in their own life that had led to luck, “planning
    my life and career carefully” landed in dead last place. Well over half the people
    in our survey thought their luck increased if they tried a new direction when
    a previous one wasn’t working. The largest percentage (64 percent) thought they
    got lucky by being curious and seeking new opportunities.

- en: But Barnaby was pointing out an important subtlety. Our respondents were completely
    right that you can’t plan everything and have to be open to new opportunities.
    The ability to recognize those possibilities (often when others don’t) lets you
    make luck. And that’s the tricky part. You need a context in order to see what’s

- en: To go back to Barnaby’s baking metaphor, you probably have flour and water and
    salt in your kitchen, but without some goal that involves making or eating or
    selling bread, those ingredients will just sit there. Once you take out the KitchenAid
    and start making that bread, your view of everything else changes. You see the
    possibilities that can make the lucky magic happen. The packages of dried fruit
    and raisins and chocolate bits that have been tucked away (unnoticed) in your
    cabinet for months suddenly take on new potential. You open them up, mix them
    in, and create a wonderful new loaf. When you win the blue ribbon at the county
    fair, you can modestly attribute it to the random chance of what happened to be
    in your cabinet. But it’s more accurate to think of it as planned serendipity.
    You hadn’t decided ahead on that particular result, but once you got on the right
    (bread-making) path, you were alert to opportunities and saw what others couldn’t.

  zh: 回到巴纳比的烘焙隐喻，你的厨房里可能有面粉、水和盐，但如果没有一个涉及制作、食用或销售面包的目标，这些原料就只会静静地待在那儿。一旦你拿出 KitchenAid
    开始做面包，你对其他事物的看法就会发生变化。你看到了能让幸运魔力发生的可能性。那些已经在你橱柜里放了几个月（无人注意）的干果、葡萄干和巧克力块，突然间变得充满了新的潜力。你打开它们，混合进去，创造出一条美妙的新面包。当你在县博览会上获得蓝带奖时，你可以谦虚地归因于橱柜里偶然存在的东西的随机巧合。但更准确的说法是，这是一种有计划的偶然性。你事先并没有决定那个特定的结果，但一旦你走上了正确的（做面包的）道路，你就会对机会保持警觉，看到了别人看不见的东西。
- en: What’s true for baking bread is also true for . . . building an airline. Barnaby
    had recently met Tony Fernandes, the entrepreneur who founded the no-frills airline
    AirAsia. As they spoke, Fernandes modestly attributed his success to serendipity.
    He told Barnaby that he had been thinking about how to create a low-cost way to
    fly for the more than half of Asians who never got on a plane. He was looking
    for the right entry point. After the tragedy of September 11, 2001, the costs
    for leasing planes dropped dramatically, so it was much easier to get into the
    business. As he said—serendipity.

- en: Barnaby pointed out that our sense of what matters—and what makes a lucky life—changes
    over the years. When you were in high school, winning a track meet probably seemed
    like the most important thing in the world, but now the first-place trophy is
    probably tucked away in the back of a closet. A few years later, you might have
    spent months obsessing about having the perfect wedding, but now that you’re raising
    four kids and two dogs, you can’t remember why that one day seemed to matter so

  zh: 巴纳比指出，我们对什么是重要的——以及什么构成幸运生活——的看法，随着岁月流逝而发生变化。当你还在高中时，赢得一次田径比赛可能是世界上最重要的事情，但现在那座第一名奖杯可能已经被塞进了衣柜的角落。几年后，你可能花了几个月的时间为完美的婚礼而焦虑，但现在你正忙着抚养四个孩子和两只狗，你甚至不记得为什么那一天曾如此重要。
- en: The trophy and the wedding may both be part of a lucky life, but a single event
    (of any sort) brings luck only when it fits into a broader picture. So, for example,
    getting the starring role in a movie when you’re just a kid could seem like the
    luckiest thing in the world. Lindsay Lohan surely felt that way when she starred
    in her first Disney movie at age twelve and had a quick streak of hits that made
    her a teen sensation before she was old enough to drive. How lucky is that! The
    years of drug abuse and rehab that followed would suggest it wasn’t very lucky
    for her at all.

  zh: 奖杯和婚礼可能都是幸运生活的一部分，但一个单一的事件（任何类型的事件）只有在它适应更广泛的图景时，才能带来好运。所以，举个例子，当你还是个孩子时，获得电影主角的角色可能看起来是世界上最幸运的事。林赛·洛汉在十二岁时主演她的第一部迪士尼电影，并且在她还没到能开车的年龄时就迎来了快速的热门电影，成为了青少年偶像，她一定觉得自己非常幸运！但随后的毒品滥用和戒毒经历则表明，这对她来说并不算什么幸运。
- en: But Lohan is barely in her early thirties now, so she may turn those bad years
    around and move forward. (Drew Barrymore did it after similar early circumstances.)
    She was on a lucky path and fell off. She can get back on it or choose a different
    path or figure out what, in a greater sense, would make a lucky life for her.

- en: The even younger actress Emma Watson got her first professional acting role
    playing Hermione Granger in the blockbuster Harry Potter movies. Uh-oh. After
    Lohan, we all knew what happened to young stars. But Emma stayed sane. She took
    time to make other movies, graduate from Brown University, and become an international
    advocate for women’s rights. Oh, and she got certified as a yoga teacher and meditates
    so that she can “always be at home with myself.” Starring in *Freaky Friday* or
    *Harry Potter* is just an event. Whether you turn it into a lucky life or a disaster
    depends on what you do with it—the path you follow, the next step you take.

- en: It made me think of the great jazz musician Miles Davis, who used to say that
    there’s no such thing as a wrong note in jazz—it’s the next note you play that
    makes it right or wrong. He could have said that there’s no such thing as a right
    note, either. You can start with something wonderful and turn it sour, or start
    with the flattest sound and make it sing. Being able to play a riff on any note—that’s

    swirling around you, and the slightest change in one or another can lead to a
    new and unexpected outcome. Scientists call this “chaos theory.” It was first
    described by the mathematician and meteorologist Edward Norton Lorenz after he
    used a computer model to make a weather prediction—and the prediction turned out
    completely wrong. Lorenz ultimately concluded that a tiny (really, really tiny)
    deviation in the first number he input to the model changed everything afterward.[*](81_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_4)

    change gets bigger and bigger and moves across the world, and before you know

    MIT Media Lab, suggesting that it was better to navigate through life with a compass
    rather than a map. I liked the image, and it struck me as exactly the way to get
    lucky. With a compass, you need to know the general direction you want to go—and
    then stay alert as you follow the twists and turns of your own path. A map (or

    miss the turns that lead to luck.

    Google 地图）则提供了一条固定的路线，当你艰难前行时，你可能会错过那些通向幸运的转弯。

    and often talks about the incredible speed of change in the technology world.
    What’s interesting is that as things move faster and faster, that compass image
    becomes even more relevant.” To make luck in a quickly changing world, you need
    a general idea where you’re headed, but you also need to be able to stay flexible
    and make turns. Going in the right direction doesn’t necessarily mean following
    the dotted line on your GPS. If everyone else is going on that path, you might
    want to choose a different one.

    day recently we were hiking on a pretty trail, and since I was worried about protruding

    the joy she once found in making movies is directed in new ways. And apparently
    it is making her happy—and radiant.

  zh: 她意识到，通过重复自己并不能创造幸运的生活，因此她开始参与抗击癌症和改革公共教育的项目。如今，十年过去了，她曾在电影制作中找到的快乐，现在以新的方式被引导。显然，这让她感到快乐——并且光彩照人。
- en: At that same conference, Barnaby spent some time talking with his friend Arianna
    Huffington, who started her eponymous *Huffington Post* from nothing and eventually
    sold it to AOL for $315 million. Like Lansing, she implicitly understood that
    part of the lucky-life equation involves switching paths at the right moment.

  zh: 在同一个会议上，Barnaby花了一些时间与他的朋友Arianna Huffington交谈，Huffington从零开始创办了以自己名字命名的*赫芬顿邮报*，最终以3.15亿美元将其出售给了AOL。像Lansing一样，她隐含地理解到，幸运人生的方程式部分在于在合适的时刻转换路径。
- en: The very determined Huffington had been on many paths in her life—author, activist,
    wife of a congressman, candidate for governor of California, conservative, and
    liberal. But *The* *Huffington Post* gave her global recognition. She told Barnaby
    that she got used to working eighteen-hour days—one sure way to make luck. But
    then one April afternoon, she collapsed at her desk from exhaustion, and as she
    fell down, her head clipped the corner of her desk, breaking her cheekbone. Her
    next memory was of being on the floor in a pool of blood and thinking, *Is this
    what success looks like?*

- en: “I used to walk down the street either talking on my phone or looking at messages.
    Then one day I looked around near where I live in SoHo and saw a most beautiful
    building. I asked my friend when it went up and she said, ‘In 1929.’” I wondered
    what else I had been missing.” It occurred to Huffington that if we’re not paying
    attention, we sometimes miss the little things—like beautiful architecture—that
    make us feel lucky. And maybe we also miss the big things, like building blocks
    for a healthy life.

- en: “I had become so used to being exhausted that it took that episode of falling
    on the floor for me to look at my life and reevaluate,” she said. Rounding out
    her financial success with a kind of spiritual and emotional good luck, she left
    *The Huffington Post* to get on a new path of spreading health and wellness and
    balance through a company that she named Thrive Global. She has even been on a
    campaign to encourage people to get more sleep—maybe luck comes with our good
    dreams.

    Global传播健康、幸福与平衡。她甚至发起了一项倡导人们多睡觉的活动——也许好运就伴随着我们的美梦而来。

- en: The idea of making luck by switching paths suddenly seemed to be in the air.
    Victor Nee, the Cornell professor we had taken a walk with through Central Park
    a few months earlier, got back in touch with Barnaby to tell him about the progress
    he was making in his study of tech firms. He had found that one indicator of success
    was how quickly a company could “rewire.”

  zh: 制造好运通过转换路径的想法突然间似乎成了流行趋势。几个月前，我们在中央公园与康奈尔大学教授Victor Nee一起散步后，他重新联系了Barnaby，告诉他自己在研究科技公司方面的进展。他发现，成功的一个标志是公司能够多快“重构”。
- en: “In tech, the ground is constantly shifting, and what was hot six months ago
    is old news today,” he said. “The critical skill becomes the ability to reinterpret
    the core strengths of a new market.” A key was an update on what he had previously
    described to us as knowledge spillover. Whatever new path you took, you could
    use the knowledge you had gained in one situation to create success and luck in
    another unrelated situation.

  zh: “在科技领域，形势不断变化，六个月前流行的东西今天已经过时了，”他说。“关键技能是能够重新解读新市场的核心优势。”一个关键点是他之前向我们介绍的知识溢出更新。不论你选择哪条新路，都可以将你在一个情境中获得的知识运用到另一个不相关的情境中，从而创造成功和好运。
- en: You don’t have to be a tech genius or a media mogul to see the value of rewiring.
    Barnaby pointed out that most of us do it naturally throughout our lives. “You
    go from being a successful college student to having a career or being a parent,”
    he said. “There are different junctures where you take different turns to make
    a new form of luck.”

- en: Remember the inverted Vs that Barnaby drew once to show me the hills and valleys
    we all face in our lives? Now he reminded me that part of climbing up and making
    luck in one area of life is climbing down again. You can try jumping from peak
    to peak, but a lucky life also includes those times in between the highs.
