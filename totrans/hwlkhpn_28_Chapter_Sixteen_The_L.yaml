- en: Barnaby came back from his Luck Lab one day excited about how far we’d come.
    He was confident that we had uncovered the ways to create lucky opportunities
    on many fronts. But for the next step, he was thinking about what luck meant in
    a larger context.

    figured out all the ingredients that go into it, but now you have to put them
    together in the right way.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The ingredients we had lined up included generating more luck for yourself in
    all sorts of ways—success in your career, confidence with your kids, energy in
    your love life, and an ability to turn bad days into good ones. All that gives
    you a sense of control over the possibilities ahead. But as you put all those
    lucky pieces together, what do they add up to in the bigger sense?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “It’s a little bit like baking,” Barnaby said. “You have the salt and the flour
    and the water, but how you blend them together makes all the difference. You can
    end up with a loaf of white bread or a fancy challah. You have to know which you
    prefer and what you’re trying to make.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Barnaby didn’t strike me as either a white bread or a challah guy—more like
    whole wheat with raisins and poppy seeds (or something equally unusual and interesting).
    But the point was fair enough. In luck and life, if you don’t know where you’re
    going, you’re probably not going to get there.

    and purpose in life, and he did a study of students on college campuses. He wanted
    to find out how college would help them reach their larger life goals. But he
    quickly realized that most of the students didn’t *have* larger life goals.
  prefs: []

    said. Students he met on campuses across the country spoke vaguely about their
    post-graduation future, but when he asked for specifics about the jobs they imagined,
    he got a lot of uncomfortable pauses and answers along the lines of “anything
    I can get” or “something that pays a lot.”[*](78_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1) The
    lack of clarity wasn’t just about their careers. Barnaby said he would have been
    happy if someone said he wanted to get married and have a house by the sea or
    hoped to return to his hometown and help his ailing parents. Anything that suggested
    a deeper reflection on life and ultimate goals.

    in our survey about elements in their own life that had led to luck, “planning
    my life and career carefully” landed in dead last place. Well over half the people
    in our survey thought their luck increased if they tried a new direction when
    a previous one wasn’t working. The largest percentage (64 percent) thought they
    got lucky by being curious and seeking new opportunities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But Barnaby was pointing out an important subtlety. Our respondents were completely
    right that you can’t plan everything and have to be open to new opportunities.
    The ability to recognize those possibilities (often when others don’t) lets you
    make luck. And that’s the tricky part. You need a context in order to see what’s
    around you.

- en: To go back to Barnaby’s baking metaphor, you probably have flour and water and
    salt in your kitchen, but without some goal that involves making or eating or
    selling bread, those ingredients will just sit there. Once you take out the KitchenAid
    and start making that bread, your view of everything else changes. You see the
    possibilities that can make the lucky magic happen. The packages of dried fruit
    and raisins and chocolate bits that have been tucked away (unnoticed) in your
    cabinet for months suddenly take on new potential. You open them up, mix them
    in, and create a wonderful new loaf. When you win the blue ribbon at the county
    fair, you can modestly attribute it to the random chance of what happened to be
    in your cabinet. But it’s more accurate to think of it as planned serendipity.
    You hadn’t decided ahead on that particular result, but once you got on the right
    (bread-making) path, you were alert to opportunities and saw what others couldn’t.

    had recently met Tony Fernandes, the entrepreneur who founded the no-frills airline
    AirAsia. As they spoke, Fernandes modestly attributed his success to serendipity.
    He told Barnaby that he had been thinking about how to create a low-cost way to
    fly for the more than half of Asians who never got on a plane. He was looking
    for the right entry point. After the tragedy of September 11, 2001, the costs
    for leasing planes dropped dramatically, so it was much easier to get into the
    business. As he said—serendipity.

    figured that I just had to keep working hard and getting As to end up with a lucky
    life. But at some point in my mid-twenties, I realized that life wasn’t the same
    as school at all. Instead of a steady path of courses and exams leading to the

    Barnaby interviewed seemed so vague. The path of success for middle-class kids
    is laid out very clearly: Do well in school, score high on your SATs, get into

    over the years. When you were in high school, winning a track meet probably seemed
    like the most important thing in the world, but now the first-place trophy is
    probably tucked away in the back of a closet. A few years later, you might have
    spent months obsessing about having the perfect wedding, but now that you’re raising
    four kids and two dogs, you can’t remember why that one day seemed to matter so
    much.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The trophy and the wedding may both be part of a lucky life, but a single event
    (of any sort) brings luck only when it fits into a broader picture. So, for example,
    getting the starring role in a movie when you’re just a kid could seem like the
    luckiest thing in the world. Lindsay Lohan surely felt that way when she starred
    in her first Disney movie at age twelve and had a quick streak of hits that made
    her a teen sensation before she was old enough to drive. How lucky is that! The
    years of drug abuse and rehab that followed would suggest it wasn’t very lucky
    for her at all.

    path or figure out what, in a greater sense, would make a lucky life for her.

    advocate for women’s rights. Oh, and she got certified as a yoga teacher and meditates
    so that she can “always be at home with myself.” Starring in *Freaky Friday* or
    *Harry Potter* is just an event. Whether you turn it into a lucky life or a disaster
    depends on what you do with it—the path you follow, the next step you take.

    there’s no such thing as a wrong note in jazz—it’s the next note you play that
    makes it right or wrong. He could have said that there’s no such thing as a right
    note, either. You can start with something wonderful and turn it sour, or start
    with the flattest sound and make it sing. Being able to play a riff on any note—that’s
    called jazz. It’s also called what makes you lucky in life.

    a call from Prince Talal of Jordan, who was visiting New York and suggested we
    get together. Because we are involved in the same international organization,
    we have gotten to know each other over the years. I always liked talking to him

    him for coffee at the St. Regis hotel sounded like a good idea.

    on a lucky path. A prince—by definition—is born lucky. Maybe luck doesn’t fall
    from the sky, but it certainly gets sprinkled down from the gene pool. Even though
    he was dressed casually (slim jeans and a James Perse T-shirt, if you must know),
    there was a regal air about him that he seems never to lose.

    massive internal injuries, he spent eight months at the Methodist Hospital in
    Houston, where he wavered on the brink of death and lost half his liver and a
    portion of his lung.

    jetty accident and just six months after his marriage to the beautiful Princess
    Ghida, he had a second big blow when he was diagnosed with cancer (non-Hodgkin’s
    lymphoma). It’s possible that the medications he took after the first injury led
    to the cancer or at least complicated the problem. So began another round of hospitalizations

    The hard work and resilience and determination and persistence that you put in
    at that point give you the lucky life (or not). Prince Talal was not giving in
    or giving up. He pushed through for a second time. And kept pushing to remake
    his life and body. He got back on the path he had earlier chosen, continued his
    military career, and climbed to the top ranks. He has the straightest posture

    an English-tailored suit so perfectly cut it could draw blood. I didn’t know about
    his accident or cancer or the real tenacity it takes to keep going when your life
    has been turned upside down. It had taken me until now to understand that whether
    you’re a prince or a king, you’re not guaranteed a life of happiness. Like everyone
    else, you make your luck happen. Prince Talal got himself on the lucky path by
    knowing that whatever gifts he had been born with could easily be taken away.

    family and title), or had I just fallen for his royal charm?

    way to increase your luck. But trying to *predict* what will happen doesn’t necessarily
    increase your luck at all. Each day, millions or billions of possibilities are
    swirling around you, and the slightest change in one or another can lead to a
    new and unexpected outcome. Scientists call this “chaos theory.” It was first
    described by the mathematician and meteorologist Edward Norton Lorenz after he
    used a computer model to make a weather prediction—and the prediction turned out
    completely wrong. Lorenz ultimately concluded that a tiny (really, really tiny)
    deviation in the first number he input to the model changed everything afterward.[*](81_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_4)

    change gets bigger and bigger and moves across the world, and before you know

    I had just come across a comment from Joi Ito, the entrepreneur and head of the
    MIT Media Lab, suggesting that it was better to navigate through life with a compass
    rather than a map. I liked the image, and it struck me as exactly the way to get
    lucky. With a compass, you need to know the general direction you want to go—and
    then stay alert as you follow the twists and turns of your own path. A map (or
    Google Maps) gives you a rigid route to follow, and as you trudge along, you may
    miss the turns that lead to luck.

    and often talks about the incredible speed of change in the technology world.
    What’s interesting is that as things move faster and faster, that compass image
    becomes even more relevant.” To make luck in a quickly changing world, you need
    a general idea where you’re headed, but you also need to be able to stay flexible
    and make turns. Going in the right direction doesn’t necessarily mean following
    the dotted line on your GPS. If everyone else is going on that path, you might
    want to choose a different one.

    watching the path while looking forward and upward and all around—which is where
    lucky sightings are made. He’d had experiences that I had missed, because if you
    keep your head down as you walk through life (either literally or metaphorically),
    you miss the opportunity to make yourself lucky. If you have an idea where you’re
    headed and the confidence that (one way or another) you’ll get there, then you
    can reach the top of the mountain—and still pause to see the magnificent hawk.

    be the best formula for creating luck over the whole arc of your life. But most
    of us are slightly myopic about the future. We have situations to deal with every
    day—problems that need solving, jobs that are demanding, and children who need
    snacks or homework help or midnight comforting. We feel lucky enough if we handle
    those immediate concerns. Like the college students Barnaby met (focused on their
    immediate concerns, like classes, beer, and football games), we know the future
    will come—but we figure it will take care of itself.

    and the Cheshire Cat,” Barnaby said. “Alice wants to go to amazing places, but
    she doesn’t know exactly where, so the cat replies that she will ultimately get
    somewhere if she simply walks long enough.”

    life will happen, good or bad. People intent on making luck ignore the Cheshire
    Cat’s advice and know ahead of time the amazing place where they want to end up.
    As Barnaby put it, they make plans and stick to them, and if the plan fails, they
    try something else and something else until they succeed in weaving past life’s
    inevitable setbacks.

    impressive people who had made luck over the whole arc of their lives by knowing
    when it was time to go in a new direction. One of them was Sherry Lansing, the
    former president of production at 20th Century Fox and CEO of Paramount Pictures.

- en: “How cool that you met her—she was always one of my role models!” I said. Lansing
    had made luck for herself at a time when it wasn’t easy for women to do that.
    She was the first woman to head a Hollywood studio and had a long string of successes,
    including movies like *Fatal Attraction* and *Titanic*. She was an inspiration
    to all of us who followed her—and was known for being creative and kind and beautiful.

    She walks into a room and you can feel the glow.”

    glamorous Hollywood life. People were shocked. Nobody gives up the bright lights
    and power unless they have to. But Lansing was determined to move on.

    take a new path,” she told Barnaby. Then offering a bit of advice, she added,
    “Change keeps you young, so never stop changing.”

    in projects to fight cancer and revamp public education. Now, ten years later,
    the joy she once found in making movies is directed in new ways. And apparently
    it is making her happy—and radiant.

    Huffington, who started her eponymous *Huffington Post* from nothing and eventually
    sold it to AOL for $315 million. Like Lansing, she implicitly understood that
    part of the lucky-life equation involves switching paths at the right moment.

    wife of a congressman, candidate for governor of California, conservative, and
    liberal. But *The* *Huffington Post* gave her global recognition. She told Barnaby
    that she got used to working eighteen-hour days—one sure way to make luck. But
    then one April afternoon, she collapsed at her desk from exhaustion, and as she
    fell down, her head clipped the corner of her desk, breaking her cheekbone. Her
    next memory was of being on the floor in a pool of blood and thinking, *Is this
    what success looks like?*

    Then one day I looked around near where I live in SoHo and saw a most beautiful
    building. I asked my friend when it went up and she said, ‘In 1929.’” I wondered
    what else I had been missing.” It occurred to Huffington that if we’re not paying
    attention, we sometimes miss the little things—like beautiful architecture—that
    make us feel lucky. And maybe we also miss the big things, like building blocks
    for a healthy life.

    on the floor for me to look at my life and reevaluate,” she said. Rounding out
    her financial success with a kind of spiritual and emotional good luck, she left
    *The Huffington Post* to get on a new path of spreading health and wellness and
    balance through a company that she named Thrive Global. She has even been on a
    campaign to encourage people to get more sleep—maybe luck comes with our good
    dreams.

- en: The idea of making luck by switching paths suddenly seemed to be in the air.
    Victor Nee, the Cornell professor we had taken a walk with through Central Park
    a few months earlier, got back in touch with Barnaby to tell him about the progress
    he was making in his study of tech firms. He had found that one indicator of success
    was how quickly a company could “rewire.”
  prefs: []

- en: “In tech, the ground is constantly shifting, and what was hot six months ago
    is old news today,” he said. “The critical skill becomes the ability to reinterpret
    the core strengths of a new market.” A key was an update on what he had previously
    described to us as knowledge spillover. Whatever new path you took, you could
    use the knowledge you had gained in one situation to create success and luck in
    another unrelated situation.

    Barnaby pointed out that most of us do it naturally throughout our lives. “You
    go from being a successful college student to having a career or being a parent,”
    he said. “There are different junctures where you take different turns to make
    a new form of luck.”

    we all face in our lives? Now he reminded me that part of climbing up and making
    luck in one area of life is climbing down again. You can try jumping from peak
    to peak, but a lucky life also includes those times in between the highs.
