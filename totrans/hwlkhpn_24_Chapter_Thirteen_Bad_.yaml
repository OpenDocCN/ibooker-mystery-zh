- en: After all the discussions I’d been having with Barnaby about the exciting paths
    for making good luck, one problem was starting to nag at me. Random bad stuff
    happens to people. You can recognize possibilities and grab at opportunities,
    you can work hard and proceed with passion and optimism, you can show unusual
    talent and even zig when others zag. But when illness strikes, a tragic accident
    occurs, or (too often in America) a mass shooter appears from nowhere, you can
    be buffeted by forces you can’t control.

- en: Barnaby agreed, but as always, he had a slightly different perspective. “Sometimes
    you need to have a bigger view to know what’s good luck or bad luck,” he said.
    Just that week at the Luck Lab, he had been talking with the renowned astrophysicist
    Piet Hut, who suggested to him that you can make good luck from bad moments by
    trying to step out of yourself and see the situation more broadly. Barnaby compared
    it to walking alone in the woods. The forest is thick all around you, so you can’t
    see anything, and maybe it’s scary. “But if you could pull back and have a big
    view from above, you’d feel differently. You’d see where you’ve come from and
    the many directions you can go. You wouldn’t feel stuck and abandoned in that
    one spot. Seeing more will give you a greater sense of control.”

    positive outcomes that might yet be. Or at least realize that they may be there

    out to be great luck tomorrow.

    a British woman named Helen who gets fired from her PR job one morning and rushes
    home. Going to the subway, she reaches the train just as the doors close in her
    face. The next train is delayed (more bad luck), so she leaves the station to
    hail a cab, and standing outside, she gets mugged (even more bad luck). With a
    slash on her head, she rushes to the hospital.

    But then the movie backs up and shows another possibility for the day. In this
    case, the train doors are still open when Helen arrives and she gets on the train.
    Much better luck! Except when she arrives at her apartment, she finds her live-in
    boyfriend in bed with another woman.

    romantic plotting is the bigger message that we never quite know how life will
    play out. Good luck can turn into bad—and vice versa. Discovering that your boyfriend
    is unfaithful could be bad luck—but what if it sets you up to meet someone better,
    kinder, and less fickle? Or to meet a tragic, unforeseen end?

    writing and his wildly popular novels featuring tough-guy hero Jack Reacher. I

    as the fictional character he famously created. Lee became a writer only after
    he was fired from the television job in the UK that he had held for thirteen years.
    He expected to be there forever, but new management came in—and he couldn’t believe
    his bad luck. He had a mortgage, a car loan, a daughter, and only a few months
    of savings in the bank. He was angry and frustrated and felt completely betrayed,
    but he channeled it all into finding his next opportunity.

    advice was impressive.

    might not again. When you’re in the midst of it, you probably don’t immediately
    see your bad luck as a good opportunity. Even if you’re as talented as Lee Child,
    you don’t know that you’re going to become an internationally famous author and
    end up with Tom Cruise starring in the movie adaptations of your books.[*](65_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1)
    It doesn’t happen for everyone, of course, and sometimes losing a job is a disaster
    from which it’s very difficult to recover. But if you have some cushion, a tough
    situation like losing a job can give you the opening to reassess what you really
    want. It may shake you out of your complacency and inspire you to take the risks
    and chances that can lead to unexpected good luck.

    nice way of saying that they were throwing her out.

    shows like *House of Cards,* you know the company figured out an entirely new
    approach. They started making their own great programs—and that made great luck,
    too. They climbed out of the valley and onto a new peak. The stock price is up
    a few hundred percent since that worst moment.

- en: Reed Hastings probably had some sleepless nights when the company was in its
    worst moments. Many entrepreneurs and CEOs have struggled through such uncertain
    transitions. But it also occurred to me that there is a big emotional difference
    between climbing down from your perch in search of something better, as Hastings
    and my friend Lia did—and being pushed, as happened to Monica and Susan Greenfield.
    In the former situation, you start with a sense of control and an awareness of
    the risks. But when the worst moments come unbidden, you have a greater struggle.
    Suddenly you’re in the valley, and you never planned to be there. All you can
    do is realize where you are and decide which hill you want to start climbing.

    strategy with astrophysicist Piet Hut, the same person who described the value
    of trying to see a situation more broadly. Hut said that if you pull back and
    imagine looking at yourself from a distance, you can see all the hills around
    you.

    after him.[*](67_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_3) He also knows about turning worst
    moments into lucky ones, because he’s had his share of both. At age thirty-two,
    he was the youngest person to be made a full professor at the Institute for Advanced
    Study and was considered a superstar. He came up with a breakthrough formula for
    measuring the movement of stars and developed the world’s fastest (at the time)
    supercomputer to simulate the behavior of galaxies. But fifteen years after giving
    him tenure, IAS claimed that Hut the superstar was more like a supernova—the kind
    that burns out. They filed a suit in court to force him to resign. The complaint
    against him said, among other things, that he had “failed to develop into an outstanding
    astrophysicist, much less a leader in the field.” Ouch. Talk about a worst moment.

    interested in Eastern philosophy, and instead of devoting himself to straight
    astrophysics, he was, as Barnaby explained, “looking at how Eastern contemplative
    traditions affect Western science.” You might say that Hut was trying to stay
    on the top of one hill while looking longingly over at another.

- en: The case was eventually settled out of court, with Hut agreeing to move out
    of the astrophysics department. His work didn’t fit into any of the four divisions
    at the institute, so they created a new interdisciplinary department that was
    essentially just for him. And that’s when the worst moment started to turn into
    a lucky one.

    runs his own research area. He can hire anyone without a lengthy vetting process
    and make his own decisions and create his own activities. If he wants to host
    yoga camps on the lawn, he can. He has the ultimate in academic freedom.”

    to look at big issues like the origins of life and order. He has helped put together
    a hundred-million-dollar consortium in Japan to look into these questions and
    launched a new organization in New York City called YHouse with a stated mission
    to understand the nature of awareness and the interface between science and technology
    and civil discourse. If that sounds like a mouthful, Barnaby explained that there
    are complex concepts to consider as robots play a bigger and bigger role in our
    lives—like whether robots can have emotions and who is accountable when a robot
    does something wrong.

    right now, and Piet has become an international leader in this kind of science,
    completely in a class by himself,” Barnaby said. “He never could have done all
    this from his previous position.”

    his real passions. And his search to understand the most basic questions about
    life and meaning could make all of us luckier, too.

    what it seems. Sometimes it’s just the impetus you need to make the good luck
    happen.
