    for making good luck, one problem was starting to nag at me. Random bad stuff
    happens to people. You can recognize possibilities and grab at opportunities,
    you can work hard and proceed with passion and optimism, you can show unusual
    talent and even zig when others zag. But when illness strikes, a tragic accident
    occurs, or (too often in America) a mass shooter appears from nowhere, you can
    be buffeted by forces you can’t control.

- en: Barnaby agreed, but as always, he had a slightly different perspective. “Sometimes
    you need to have a bigger view to know what’s good luck or bad luck,” he said.
    Just that week at the Luck Lab, he had been talking with the renowned astrophysicist
    Piet Hut, who suggested to him that you can make good luck from bad moments by
    trying to step out of yourself and see the situation more broadly. Barnaby compared
    it to walking alone in the woods. The forest is thick all around you, so you can’t
    see anything, and maybe it’s scary. “But if you could pull back and have a big
    view from above, you’d feel differently. You’d see where you’ve come from and
    the many directions you can go. You wouldn’t feel stuck and abandoned in that
    one spot. Seeing more will give you a greater sense of control.”

    out to be great luck tomorrow.

    a British woman named Helen who gets fired from her PR job one morning and rushes
    home. Going to the subway, she reaches the train just as the doors close in her
    face. The next train is delayed (more bad luck), so she leaves the station to
    hail a cab, and standing outside, she gets mugged (even more bad luck). With a
    slash on her head, she rushes to the hospital.

    Much better luck! Except when she arrives at her apartment, she finds her live-in
    boyfriend in bed with another woman.

    romantic plotting is the bigger message that we never quite know how life will
    play out. Good luck can turn into bad—and vice versa. Discovering that your boyfriend

    kinder, and less fickle? Or to meet a tragic, unforeseen end?

    as the fictional character he famously created. Lee became a writer only after
    he was fired from the television job in the UK that he had held for thirteen years.
    He expected to be there forever, but new management came in—and he couldn’t believe
    his bad luck. He had a mortgage, a car loan, a daughter, and only a few months
    of savings in the bank. He was angry and frustrated and felt completely betrayed,
    but he channeled it all into finding his next opportunity.

    might not again. When you’re in the midst of it, you probably don’t immediately
    see your bad luck as a good opportunity. Even if you’re as talented as Lee Child,
    you don’t know that you’re going to become an internationally famous author and
    end up with Tom Cruise starring in the movie adaptations of your books.[*](65_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1)
    It doesn’t happen for everyone, of course, and sometimes losing a job is a disaster
    from which it’s very difficult to recover. But if you have some cushion, a tough
    situation like losing a job can give you the opening to reassess what you really
    want. It may shake you out of your complacency and inspire you to take the risks
    and chances that can lead to unexpected good luck.

  zh: 巴纳比指着他纸上的倒V形图，手指停在其中一座中型山丘的顶端。“如果你想从这里到这里”——他将手指移到一座更高的山丘上——“那么你必须先下山。没有从山顶到山顶的直达路径。所以，为了优化你的运气，你可能得穿越一个山谷。”
- en: Transitions are never easy. If you want something more than you have, you often
    need to risk your current situation to get it. Is it better to stay put on that
    medium-sized hill or try to make luck by reaching the bigger mountain? Those questions
    crop up in our personal lives, too.

- en: I thought of my college friend Lia, who had been married for a long time and
    had a couple of lovely grown-up kids. To outside observers, she was puttering
    along quite well, and you could say she was sitting on the top of one of those
    medium-sized hills. But she wasn’t completely happy and felt her life lacked the
    romance and passion and adventure she still wanted. Getting that would require
    moving to a different hill and starting the climb all over again.

  zh: 我想起了我的大学朋友莉娅，她已婚多年，并且有两个可爱的成年孩子。从外人看来，她过得相当不错，可以说她正坐在一座中型山丘的顶端。但她并不完全幸福，觉得自己的生活缺少她依然渴望的浪漫、激情和冒险。要得到这些，她需要搬到另一座山丘，重新开始攀登。
- en: And that’s what she did. In what had to be the worst year of her life, Lia separated
    from her husband and then managed to pull off an amicable divorce. She ended up
    in a small apartment with a few pieces of furniture and a lot of uncertainty.
    But she was willing to take the risk to reach the goal she wanted. Now a couple
    of years have passed, and she and a new love are over-the-moon happy and planning
    their future together—the one she imagined. Her kids are understanding, and her
    ex-husband remains her friend. She’s on her way to the peak of that much bigger
    hill that she wanted—real happiness.

  zh: 她就是这么做的。在她人生中最糟糕的一年，莉娅与丈夫分开，之后成功地办理了友好的离婚。她最终住进了一间小公寓，里面只有几件家具，满是未知的未来。但她愿意冒险去追求自己想要的目标。现在几年过去了，她和一位新爱人过得非常幸福，并且一起规划未来——那是她曾经想象过的未来。她的孩子们理解她，前夫依然是她的朋友。她正朝着她所渴望的更高山丘的顶峰前进——真正的幸福。
- en: A lot of people thought Lia was a little crazy to leave that previous hill (aka
    her longtime marriage). Who knew how it would end up? The immediate future looked
    glum. But making luck sometimes requires a willingness to climb down and go into
    the valley. You endure the worst moment (or year) of your life in order to go
    for the luckier one.

  zh: 很多人认为莉娅离开之前的那座山丘（也就是她的长期婚姻）有些疯狂。谁知道结局会怎样呢？眼前的未来看起来并不乐观。但有时候，创造好运气需要勇于下山并进入山谷。你承受人生中最糟糕的时刻（或一年），就是为了争取更幸运的时刻。

- en: Companies are often in a similar position. To change and get to the higher peak,
    they have to go through that valley—which in corporate terms can mean a lower
    stock price or reduced profits. I mentioned to Barnaby that I’d been watching
    a movie on Netflix the previous night, and we discussed how that company had gone
    through big changes.

- en: Netflix started as a DVD-by-mail business (remember those days?) and managed
    to put Blockbuster out of business. It was definitely on the top of one medium-sized
    heap. But CEO Reed Hastings looked around and realized he could make greater luck
    on the bigger hill of streaming video. Great idea—except once he moved away from
    the mail-only model and began experimenting with some controversial pricing strategies,
    the company was widely attacked. At one point in 2011, the Netflix stock price
    plunged 80 percent.

    shows like *House of Cards,* you know the company figured out an entirely new
    approach. They started making their own great programs—and that made great luck,
    too. They climbed out of the valley and onto a new peak. The stock price is up
    a few hundred percent since that worst moment.

- en: Reed Hastings probably had some sleepless nights when the company was in its
    worst moments. Many entrepreneurs and CEOs have struggled through such uncertain
    transitions. But it also occurred to me that there is a big emotional difference
    between climbing down from your perch in search of something better, as Hastings
    and my friend Lia did—and being pushed, as happened to Monica and Susan Greenfield.
    In the former situation, you start with a sense of control and an awareness of
    the risks. But when the worst moments come unbidden, you have a greater struggle.
    Suddenly you’re in the valley, and you never planned to be there. All you can
    do is realize where you are and decide which hill you want to start climbing.

- en: Barnaby told me that at his Luck Lab, he had been talking about the hill-climbing
    strategy with astrophysicist Piet Hut, the same person who described the value
    of trying to see a situation more broadly. Hut said that if you pull back and
    imagine looking at yourself from a distance, you can see all the hills around
    you.

- en: Hut should know about seeing things from a distance—he has an asteroid named
    after him.[*](67_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_3) He also knows about turning worst
    moments into lucky ones, because he’s had his share of both. At age thirty-two,
    he was the youngest person to be made a full professor at the Institute for Advanced
    Study and was considered a superstar. He came up with a breakthrough formula for
    measuring the movement of stars and developed the world’s fastest (at the time)
    supercomputer to simulate the behavior of galaxies. But fifteen years after giving
    him tenure, IAS claimed that Hut the superstar was more like a supernova—the kind
    that burns out. They filed a suit in court to force him to resign. The complaint
    against him said, among other things, that he had “failed to develop into an outstanding
    astrophysicist, much less a leader in the field.” Ouch. Talk about a worst moment.

    interested in Eastern philosophy, and instead of devoting himself to straight
    astrophysics, he was, as Barnaby explained, “looking at how Eastern contemplative
    traditions affect Western science.” You might say that Hut was trying to stay
    on the top of one hill while looking longingly over at another.

  zh: 但公平地说，这对赫特来说并非完全是出乎意料的。他开始对东方哲学产生兴趣，而不是一心投入于纯粹的天体物理学。正如巴纳比所解释的那样，他“在研究东方冥想传统如何影响西方科学”。你可以说，赫特试图站在一座山的顶端，同时又向另一座山望去，心生向往。
- en: The case was eventually settled out of court, with Hut agreeing to move out
    of the astrophysics department. His work didn’t fit into any of the four divisions
    at the institute, so they created a new interdisciplinary department that was
    essentially just for him. And that’s when the worst moment started to turn into
    a lucky one.

- en: “It turned out even luckier than he could have imagined,” Barnaby said. “He
    runs his own research area. He can hire anyone without a lengthy vetting process
    and make his own decisions and create his own activities. If he wants to host
    yoga camps on the lawn, he can. He has the ultimate in academic freedom.”

- en: Instead of hosting yoga camps, Hut has been using the extraordinary freedom
    to look at big issues like the origins of life and order. He has helped put together
    a hundred-million-dollar consortium in Japan to look into these questions and
    launched a new organization in New York City called YHouse with a stated mission
    to understand the nature of awareness and the interface between science and technology
    and civil discourse. If that sounds like a mouthful, Barnaby explained that there
    are complex concepts to consider as robots play a bigger and bigger role in our
    lives—like whether robots can have emotions and who is accountable when a robot
    does something wrong.

  zh: 赫特没有举办瑜伽营，而是利用这份非凡的自由，去关注生命起源和秩序等重大问题。他帮助在日本组建了一个价值上亿美元的联盟，研究这些问题，并在纽约市成立了一个名为YHouse的新组织，明确的使命是理解意识的本质，以及科学与技术、公共讨论之间的界面。如果这听起来有些复杂，巴纳比解释说，这涉及到一些复杂的概念，因为随着机器人在我们生活中扮演越来越重要的角色，有很多问题需要考虑——比如机器人是否能拥有情感，以及当机器人犯错时，应该由谁负责。
