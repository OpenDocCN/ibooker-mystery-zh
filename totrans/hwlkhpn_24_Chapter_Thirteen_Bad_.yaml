- en: After all the discussions I’d been having with Barnaby about the exciting paths
    for making good luck, one problem was starting to nag at me. Random bad stuff
    happens to people. You can recognize possibilities and grab at opportunities,
    you can work hard and proceed with passion and optimism, you can show unusual
    talent and even zig when others zag. But when illness strikes, a tragic accident
    occurs, or (too often in America) a mass shooter appears from nowhere, you can
    be buffeted by forces you can’t control.

  zh: 在与巴纳比讨论了那么多创造好运的激动人心的路径后，我开始感到有一个问题在困扰着我。人们会遇到随机的坏事。你可以识别可能性并抓住机会，你可以努力工作，充满激情和乐观地前进，你可以展现出非凡的才能，甚至在人们都走直路时你也能走岔路。但当疾病降临、发生悲剧性事故，或者（在美国太常见的）突如其来的大规模枪击事件发生时，你可能会被那些你无法控制的力量冲击。
- en: Barnaby agreed, but as always, he had a slightly different perspective. “Sometimes
    you need to have a bigger view to know what’s good luck or bad luck,” he said.
    Just that week at the Luck Lab, he had been talking with the renowned astrophysicist
    Piet Hut, who suggested to him that you can make good luck from bad moments by
    trying to step out of yourself and see the situation more broadly. Barnaby compared
    it to walking alone in the woods. The forest is thick all around you, so you can’t
    see anything, and maybe it’s scary. “But if you could pull back and have a big
    view from above, you’d feel differently. You’d see where you’ve come from and
    the many directions you can go. You wouldn’t feel stuck and abandoned in that
    one spot. Seeing more will give you a greater sense of control.”

  zh: 巴纳比同意了，但像往常一样，他有着稍微不同的看法。“有时候你需要更广的视角才能判断什么是好运，什么是坏运，”他说。就在那一周，在幸运实验室，他与著名天体物理学家皮特·赫特（Piet
    Hut）交谈时，赫特建议他，遇到坏时刻时，通过尽量跳出自我，从更广阔的角度看待问题，你可以从坏运气中创造出好运气。巴纳比把这比作独自在森林中走路。四周的森林茂密，你看不到任何东西，可能会觉得害怕。“但是，如果你能后退一步，从高处俯瞰，你会有不同的感受。你会看到你走过的路，以及你可以走的多个方向。你不会觉得自己被困住，或者被遗弃在一个地方。看得更远，会让你有更强的掌控感。”
- en: You can’t step outside your body in real life, but you can try to imagine the
    positive outcomes that might yet be. Or at least realize that they may be there
    even if you *can’t* imagine them. What looks like terrible luck today could turn
    out to be great luck tomorrow.

- en: It reminded me of the 1998 movie *Sliding Doors*, in which Gwyneth Paltrow plays
    a British woman named Helen who gets fired from her PR job one morning and rushes
    home. Going to the subway, she reaches the train just as the doors close in her
    face. The next train is delayed (more bad luck), so she leaves the station to
    hail a cab, and standing outside, she gets mugged (even more bad luck). With a
    slash on her head, she rushes to the hospital.

  zh: 这让我想起了1998年电影《穿越时空的少女》(*Sliding Doors*)，在这部电影中，格温妮丝·帕特洛（Gwyneth Paltrow）饰演一位名叫海伦的英国女性，她在某个早晨被公关公司解雇，急匆匆赶回家。她赶到地铁时，正好赶上列车关门。下一班车延误了（更倒霉），于是她离开车站打出租车，在站外她被抢劫了（更倒霉）。头部被划伤，她匆忙赶往医院。
- en: Not a lucky day, right? You might say that everything that could go wrong did.
    But then the movie backs up and shows another possibility for the day. In this
    case, the train doors are still open when Helen arrives and she gets on the train.
    Much better luck! Except when she arrives at her apartment, she finds her live-in
    boyfriend in bed with another woman.

  zh: 这不是个幸运的日子，对吧？你可能会说一切都出了问题。但接下来，电影倒带，展示了这一天的另一种可能性。这次，当海伦到达时，车门依然敞开，她顺利地上了车。运气好多了！可是，当她到达公寓时，发现同居的男朋友正和另一个女人躺在床上。
- en: In the rest of the movie, both scenarios continue to unfold. And beneath the
    romantic plotting is the bigger message that we never quite know how life will
    play out. Good luck can turn into bad—and vice versa. Discovering that your boyfriend
    is unfaithful could be bad luck—but what if it sets you up to meet someone better,
    kinder, and less fickle? Or to meet a tragic, unforeseen end?

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 在电影的其余部分，这两种情境继续展开。在浪漫的剧情下，隐藏着一个更深的主题，那就是我们永远无法完全知道生活会如何发展。好运可以转变为坏运——反之亦然。发现男朋友不忠可能是坏运气——但如果它为你提供了遇到一个更好、更善良、更不变心的人，呢？或者让你迎来一个悲惨且意外的结局？
- en: We can’t always predict how events will unfold, and if parallel universes exist,
    we don’t yet have access to them. So all you can do is take the current event
    that has been handed to you and try to turn it into good luck rather than bad.

- en: Back when I was running a big magazine, I called author Lee Child one morning
    and asked if he would like to write a cover story for me. I admired Lee’s vigorous
    writing and his wildly popular novels featuring tough-guy hero Jack Reacher. I
    thought he might be a nice match to interview the (then) famously recalcitrant
    actor Robert De Niro. Lee agreed, and a few days later, I got his report.

  zh: 在我经营一本大杂志的时候，有一天早晨我给作家李·查尔德打电话，问他是否愿意为我写一篇封面故事。我非常欣赏李充满活力的写作风格以及他那部深受欢迎的小说系列，主角是硬汉英雄杰克·里奇。
    我觉得他可能是采访（当时）著名固执演员罗伯特·德尼罗的合适人选。李答应了，几天后，我收到了他的报道。

  zh: “当你派杰克·里奇去完成一项任务时，他一定会完成的。”李回答道。
- en: I laughed, and when we talked again, I discovered that Lee really was as determined
    as the fictional character he famously created. Lee became a writer only after
    he was fired from the television job in the UK that he had held for thirteen years.
    He expected to be there forever, but new management came in—and he couldn’t believe
    his bad luck. He had a mortgage, a car loan, a daughter, and only a few months
    of savings in the bank. He was angry and frustrated and felt completely betrayed,
    but he channeled it all into finding his next opportunity.
  id: totrans-15

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 我笑了，当我们再次交谈时，我发现李确实像他所创作的那个著名角色一样坚定。李是在被解雇之前才成为作家的，他在英国做电视工作已经有十三年了。他本以为自己会在那里呆一辈子，但新的管理层接手了——他简直不敢相信自己的坏运气。他有房贷、车贷、一个女儿，银行里也只有几个月的储蓄。他愤怒、沮丧，感到完全被背叛，但他把这些情绪转化为寻找下一个机会的动力。
- en: “I’m a naturally belligerent person. Show me a challenge, and I’ll beat it or
    die trying,” he said.

  zh: “我是一个天生好斗的人。给我一个挑战，我要么战胜它，要么死在尝试的路上。”他说。
- en: So he created Jack Reacher, who got his steely resolve after he was downsized
    out of the Marines. Lee, and Jack, had the determination to turn bad luck to good.
    Lee later wrote a piece for me about how you move on after losing a job, and his
    advice was impressive.

  zh: 所以他创造了杰克·里奇，这个角色在从海军陆战队退役后获得了坚定的决心。李和杰克一样，拥有将坏运气转化为好运的决心。李后来为我写了一篇关于如何在失业后继续前行的文章，他的建议令人印象深刻。
- en: “Try something. Anything. Sit back, take a breath, believe in yourself, identify
    your dream, and go for it 110%. Trust me, your motivation will never be as strong.
    And the chance might never come your way again,” he wrote.

  zh: “试试这个。做任何事。坐下来，深呼吸，相信自己，明确你的梦想，并全力以赴。相信我，你的动力永远不会像现在这么强烈。而这个机会可能再也不会出现在你面前了。”他写道。
- en: I loved his perspective that bad luck is a chance that has come your way—and
    might not again. When you’re in the midst of it, you probably don’t immediately
    see your bad luck as a good opportunity. Even if you’re as talented as Lee Child,
    you don’t know that you’re going to become an internationally famous author and
    end up with Tom Cruise starring in the movie adaptations of your books.[*](65_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1)
    It doesn’t happen for everyone, of course, and sometimes losing a job is a disaster
    from which it’s very difficult to recover. But if you have some cushion, a tough
    situation like losing a job can give you the opening to reassess what you really
    want. It may shake you out of your complacency and inspire you to take the risks
    and chances that can lead to unexpected good luck.

  zh: 我喜欢他那种看法：坏运气其实是一个机会——而且这个机会可能再也不会出现在你面前。当你正处于困境中时，你可能不会立即把坏运气看作是一个好机会。即使你像李·查尔德那样才华横溢，你也无法预见到自己会成为国际著名作家，最终让汤姆·克鲁斯出演你书中的电影改编作品。[*](65_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1)
    当然，并不是每个人都能如此顺利，有时候失业可能是一个灾难，令人很难从中恢复过来。但如果你有一些经济保障，像失业这样的一次困境，可能为你提供了重新评估真正想要的东西的机会。它可能会把你从自满中摇醒，激励你去冒险，去抓住那些能够带来意外好运的机会。

    peer, which means you’re not born into the House of Lords—you do something important

  zh: 我很快发现，来自牛津郡奥特穆尔的格林菲尔德女爵士（真是，英式名称是不是让人喜欢？）之所以获得这个头衔，是因为她作为一名科学家在研究大脑生理学方面的贡献。她是英式贵族中所谓的“终身贵族”，这意味着你不是出生在上议院，而是做出了某些重要的事情才得以进入。忘掉那些大庄园和与女王会面的浪漫情景吧——这位女爵士在阿尔茨海默病的研究上做出了令人印象深刻的贡献，并且花了很多时间在试管旁边徘徊。

    to give an important series of talks called the Christmas Lectures at the Royal

    that a development program Greenfield had led—with full backing of the board—had

    hotel in Santa Monica. It’s always been one of my favorite spots—situated at the

    and make his own decisions and create his own activities. If he wants to host
    yoga camps on the lawn, he can. He has the ultimate in academic freedom.”

  zh: “结果比他想象的还要幸运，”巴纳比说道，“他掌管自己的研究领域，可以随意聘请任何人，不需要经过繁琐的审核流程，自己做决定，开展自己的活动。如果他想在草坪上举办瑜伽营，也可以。他拥有最彻底的学术自由。”
- en: Instead of hosting yoga camps, Hut has been using the extraordinary freedom
    to look at big issues like the origins of life and order. He has helped put together
    a hundred-million-dollar consortium in Japan to look into these questions and
    launched a new organization in New York City called YHouse with a stated mission
    to understand the nature of awareness and the interface between science and technology
    and civil discourse. If that sounds like a mouthful, Barnaby explained that there
    are complex concepts to consider as robots play a bigger and bigger role in our
    lives—like whether robots can have emotions and who is accountable when a robot
    does something wrong.

  zh: 赫特没有举办瑜伽营，而是利用这份非凡的自由，去关注生命起源和秩序等重大问题。他帮助在日本组建了一个价值上亿美元的联盟，研究这些问题，并在纽约市成立了一个名为YHouse的新组织，明确的使命是理解意识的本质，以及科学与技术、公共讨论之间的界面。如果这听起来有些复杂，巴纳比解释说，这涉及到一些复杂的概念，因为随着机器人在我们生活中扮演越来越重要的角色，有很多问题需要考虑——比如机器人是否能拥有情感，以及当机器人犯错时，应该由谁负责。
- en: “These are topics being mulled by the biggest technology companies in the world
    right now, and Piet has become an international leader in this kind of science,
    completely in a class by himself,” Barnaby said. “He never could have done all
    this from his previous position.”

  zh: “这些是全球最大科技公司现在正在思考的话题，而皮特已经成为这种科学领域的国际领袖，完全处于一个独立的类别。”巴纳比说道，“如果他还在之前的位置，根本无法做成这些事情。”
- en: The worst moment for Piet Hut led to the lucky opportunity he wanted to pursue
    his real passions. And his search to understand the most basic questions about
    life and meaning could make all of us luckier, too.

    what it seems. Sometimes it’s just the impetus you need to make the good luck
    happen.
