- en: In talking about the need to make your own luck, Barnaby and I often used the
    shorthand that luck doesn’t fall from the sky—but we understood that if you want
    to be literal, even that truth isn’t 100 percent accurate. A woman named Ann Hodges
    was at her home in Sylacauga, Alabama, one day in 1954, napping on the couch under
    a big quilt, when a hunk of black rock crashed through the ceiling and hit her
    on the thigh. With that (unlucky) burst from the sky, she became the only confirmed
    person in history to have been hit by a meteorite.

  zh: 在谈到创造自己好运的必要性时，我和巴纳比常常用一种简短的说法：好运不会从天而降——但我们明白，如果你想要字面上的解释，即使这个事实也并非百分之百准确。1954年，一位名叫安·霍奇斯（Ann
    Hodges）的女性在阿拉巴马州西拉考加的家中，正躺在沙发上盖着大被子打盹时，一块黑色岩石从天花板坠下，砸在她的大腿上。由于这一（不幸的）天外飞石，她成为历史上唯一确认被陨石砸中的人。
- en: You probably shouldn’t spend a lot of time worrying about meteorite strikes
    since “it’s more likely you get hit by a tornado and a bolt of lightning and a
    hurricane all at the same time,” Florida State College astronomer Michael Reynolds
    said about that remarkable hit. And yet we do worry. Scientists say an asteroid
    that smashed into the earth 66 million years ago led to a change in climate that
    caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. It was long ago and rare, but who knows—if
    there’s an asteroid strike every 66 million years, another may be due tomorrow.[*](36_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1)

  zh: 你可能不应该花太多时间担心陨石撞击，因为“你被龙卷风、闪电和飓风同时击中的可能性更大，”佛罗里达州立大学天文学家迈克尔·雷诺兹（Michael Reynolds）在谈到这次惊人的撞击时说道。尽管如此，我们还是会担心。科学家表示，6600万年前撞击地球的小行星引发了气候变化，导致恐龙灭绝。那是久远而罕见的事件，但谁知道呢——如果每66百万年就有一次陨石撞击，也许明天就会发生另一次。[*](36_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1)
- en: Now that I was thinking of luck as a combination of chance, talent, and hard
    work, I had decided that the wisest approach was to put chance aside and focus
    on the other two—the ones you could control. But I also understood that the unpredicted
    and the unforeseen can seem overwhelming. If you’re going to be hit by a meteorite,
    everything else seems kind of unimportant.

- en: So before figuring out the principles of making luck, I wanted to get a little
    better perspective on randomness. We’ve all had situations that seem like crazy
    coincidence—you’re traveling in a remote location and run into someone you know,
    or an old friend from college calls just as you’re thinking about her. Your reaction
    is probably *Amazing! What are the odds?*

- en: Impossible odds don’t mean something is impossible. In 2016, the English football
    club Leicester City was given a 5,000–1 chance of winning the championship of
    the Premier League. For some perspective, bookmakers gave the same odds to Bono
    becoming the next pope. Essentially those odds mean *Are you crazy? It’s not going

    *你疯了吗？根本不可能发生。*
- en: The Premier League is big and powerful, with no draft or salary caps, and the
    same four teams have won the championship for the previous twenty years. Little
    underfunded Leicester City had lost so many games the previous season that they
    barely escaped being tossed out of the league altogether. The closest they had
    come to a championship was finishing second in the 1928–29 season. They spent
    about a tenth as much on their players as the more popular teams like Manchester
    United and Arsenal.
  id: totrans-10

- en: But with all that, they won. One way to think of 5,000–1 odds is that if the
    teams in the Premier League played for five thousand years, Leicester City would
    win the title once. The BBC called it “one of the greatest sporting stories of
    all time.” Closer to home, NBC Sports said, “It’s not like anything we can comprehend
    in America.” Others noted that during spring training in America, even the worst
    baseball teams are given 500–1 (or so) odds of winning the World Series. Leicester
    City was considered ten times worse than the worst.

    for why it all happened. They praised the analytics the team used in recruiting
    and signing players, pointed to the surprising coach, and noted that the famous
    four top teams all sputtered. Had the players on Leicester City made their luck
    (as the first two explanations would suggest), or was it simply that year 5000
    comes around if you wait long enough? I certainly don’t know enough about English
    football to say—but it’s definitely easier to explain an event after it occurs

- en: I ate the banana bread. And since the topic intrigued me, I did a little more
    research later and found out that Barnaby was completely right. Most studies show
    that genetic factors play only a small part in obesity, and lifestyle is more
    important than anything else. Research out of the Harvard School of Public Health
    shows that even if you have the genes associated with obesity, what you eat and
    how much you exercise will have a greater influence on your shape than your genetics.
    Where you live has a role in obesity, too. In some states (topped by Alabama),
    obesity is over 35 percent, while in Colorado, the perennially leanest state,
    it’s more like 20 percent. But if you live in one of the fattest states and eat
    fruit and vegetables and go for daily runs, you’ll easily beat the odds. In fact,
    the overall odds won’t apply to you at all.

  zh: 我吃了那块香蕉面包。由于这个话题让我很感兴趣，之后我做了一些额外的研究，发现 Barnaby 完全是对的。大多数研究表明，遗传因素对肥胖的影响很小，生活方式比其他任何因素都重要。哈佛公共卫生学院的研究显示，即使你有肥胖基因，饮食和运动量对你的身材的影响也会远远超过遗传因素。你所在的地方也会影响肥胖。在一些州（如阿拉巴马州），肥胖率超过35%，而在科罗拉多州——这个常年保持最瘦的州——大约是20%。但如果你生活在这些肥胖率较高的州，仍然坚持吃水果蔬菜并每天跑步，你完全有可能打破这些统计数据。事实上，整体的统计数据根本不适用于你。
- en: As we continued with our breakfast discussion of risk and statistics, Barnaby
    surprised me by telling me that when his first daughter, Mandarin, was born, he
    wanted her to share the bed with her parents. His wife, Michelle, thought it was
    a terrible idea. She told Barnaby that co-sleeping babies are five times more
    likely to die than those who are put safely in their own cribs. Some are crushed
    when parents roll over on them, and others suffocate in sheets and blankets or
    get wedged in the sides of beds. There is also a clear connection between the
    devastation of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and co-sleeping. One comprehensive
    review showed that 69 percent of babies who died of SIDS slept in their parents’
    bed. The statistics were pretty clear—the safest place for a baby is in a crib.

  zh: 当我们继续讨论风险与统计学的话题时，Barnaby 让我吃惊地告诉我，当他的第一个女儿 Mandarin 出生时，他希望她能和父母一起睡。可是他的妻子
    Michelle 认为这是个糟糕的主意。她告诉 Barnaby，共睡的婴儿比放在自己小床上的婴儿死亡的几率要高五倍。有的婴儿被父母压住而窒息，有的则是被床单和被子闷住，或者被卡在床边。突发婴儿死亡综合症（SIDS）和共同睡眠之间也有明显的关联。一项综合评估显示，69%的死于SIDS的婴儿是和父母一起睡的。统计数据非常清楚——婴儿最安全的地方是婴儿床。

  zh: “但世界各地的婴儿传统上都是和母亲一起睡的，我觉得这样对哺乳和其他方面有好处。所以我重新审视了这些统计数据，”Barnaby 说道。
- en: He found that many of the risks of co-sleeping occurred when parents were intoxicated
    or obese or had lower education levels. Another key problem involved sleeping
    on a soft surface—a couch, waterbed, or squishy mattress—and having an excess
    number of blankets. None of those factors applied in the case of his family.

  zh: 他发现，共睡的风险往往发生在父母醉酒、肥胖或教育水平较低的情况下。另一个关键问题是睡在柔软的表面上——如沙发、水床或软床垫上——并且被褥过多。对于他的家庭来说，这些因素都不适用。
- en: “So I calculated that the standard reference statistic being used of a one in
    a thousand risk was probably much lower for us,” Barnaby said. “By changing or
    eliminating certain risk factors, you can shift the risk curve—and effectively

    1992, an Australian investor syndicate came up with a strategy for getting lucky
    in the lottery. Instead of buying just one (or two or three) tickets, they planned
    to win the Virginia Lottery by buying a ticket for every possible combination.
    At the time, each of the one-dollar tickets had six bubbles that could be filled
    with a number from 1 to 44, which meant there were some 7 million combinations.
    Filling out all those little forms would take a very long time, so they bought
    blocks of tickets through more than a hundred different retailers. It kept the
    stores humming. “No one wants to be in line behind anyone who’s there for three
    or four days,” said one disgruntled Virginian in a public hearing after the lottery
    fix. The syndicate managed to get only 5 million of the 7 million combinations

  zh: 如果你理解了概率，你就可以与之共舞。例如，在1992年，澳大利亚的一家投资者联合体想出了一个在彩票中获得好运的策略。他们并不只买一张（或两张或三张）彩票，而是计划通过购买每一种可能组合的票来赢得弗吉尼亚州彩票。当时，每张一美元的彩票上有六个空格，可以填上1到44之间的数字，这意味着有大约700万个组合。填写所有这些小表格需要很长时间，因此他们通过100多家不同的零售商购买了大量的彩票。这让这些商店忙得不可开交。“没有人愿意站在排队三四天的人的后面，”一位弗吉尼亚州的不满居民在彩票被修正后的公开听证会上说。联合体在时间用完之前只买到了700万个组合中的500万个——但幸运的是，他们的概率站在了自己这一方，他们赢得了2700万美元的大奖。
- en: 'You probably don’t want to try this at home. Even if you could borrow the money
    to buy all those tickets, most state lotteries are now dramatically harder to
    fix. (Having the number of choices go up to 49 instead of 44 may not sound like
    a big deal, but it doubles the possible combinations to 14 million.) And even
    if you win, you always run the risk of having to share the big bucks with other
    ticket holders who (randomly) picked the right combination. In major lotteries,
    like the national Mega Millions drawings, it would be impossible to print the
    necessary number of tickets, no matter how many retailers you had on your side.
    But the Australian investors were right in their general theory: If you increase
    your chances, you increase your odds.'

    career, he advised for an oil company (the man has done everything!), which made
    him think a lot about different kinds of risk—and how they pay off. As Barnaby
    explained it, geologists typically go out with sounding equipment to look for
    pockets in the earth where there may be oil. After they collect extensive data
    and find possibilities (and it’s never a certainty), the company has to decide
    which spots to pursue. Drilling is expensive, so they can’t drill everywhere.

    yield profitability for the company. But there’s also the pressure for huge finds
    in unexpected places that are expensive to explore. It’s hard to go after both,
    so you have to choose one or the other. And those different approaches attract
    different kinds of risk takers, whether they are engineers or executives,” Barnaby
    said.

    small-percentage play that has a huge payoff? Or take the safer course that yields
    less dramatic but more constant results? In other words, should you encourage
    your child when he watches a basketball game and says all he wants in life is
    to play in the NBA? Unless he’s six-foot-seven and never misses a three-point
    shot, possibly not. We love hearing about people who think huge, take on the impossible,
    and win, but you can have an equally good life on a surer path and a safer bet.

    engineer can decide to spend ten years freezing in the Arctic looking for that
    undiscovered gusher that will change everything. Or he can go to the warm spot
    in Houston with predictable fields that will generate a steady return. Movie studios
    face the same question. They can take on the safe and somewhat predictable theme
    (hello, *Batman—Part 18*), or try something off-the-wall and different that will
    probably flop but may be a megahit. A college senior thinking about his future
    makes a similar calculation. Go to dental school for a sure and secure future?
    Or become an entrepreneur and invest everything in your idea for a start-up selling
    ice-cream sandwiches by mail?

    dentists go broke versus how many start-up entrepreneurs. You can check how many
    people like ice cream and how many competitors you would have. Calculate your
    chances of success and decide the luckiest path. But the “what are the odds?”
    approach is just not how most of us are wired. We make decisions based on popular
    information or what our friends have done or we follow our hearts (which leads
    to some very foolish risks). If your college roommate had a successful start-up,
    you’re probably more likely to jump in and try one, too. We expect good outcomes
    even when they are highly unlikely, and we ignore potential downsides.

    book *The Drunkard’s Walk* had long been a favorite of mine. He had an appealing
    way of explaining statistical chance and once (somewhat whimsically) wondered
    how many people would enter a state lottery if the likely outcome was presented
    as one person would win a fortune, millions of others would get nothing, and one
    person would die a violent death. Because that’s pretty much what happens. Pulling
    together statistics on car accidents and estimates of how many people make an
    extra trip to buy a ticket, he figured there’s about one additional car fatality
    per major lottery. But who ever takes that into account when deciding whether
    or not to buy a lottery ticket?

    month for everyone who worked at the company. Along with fruit platters and too
    many cream doughnuts, we served up sweepstakes tickets to everyone who attended.
    Then the CEO pulled numbers out of a hat to award the prizes—dinner for two at
    a restaurant, gift baskets, a designer scarf. As the winners rushed forward to
    claim their prizes, at least one of them would invariably shout, “I can’t believe
    it! I’ve never won anything before!”

    means beating the odds. But Barnaby told me that his wife, Michelle, regularly
    entered the drawing at their local Trader Joe’s for a week of free groceries.
    Thousands of people went to that very popular store—but she had won three times.

    like to point out that there’s a big difference between asking how likely it is
    that Michelle will win three times and how likely it is that *someone* will win
    three times. Think of it this way. If ten thousand people drop their entries into
    the bowl each week, you have a 1-in-10,000 chance of winning. But there’s a 100
    percent chance that someone will win—and the same person winning twice in a few
    months isn’t as unusual as it may sound. Mathematicians refer to it as the law
    of big numbers, and it gives us a new way of thinking about odds. Some years ago
    a woman in New Jersey won the state lottery twice in four months. Even more amazing
    than Michelle’s groceries, right? Reporters said she had beaten odds of 1 in 17
    trillion. But then two statisticians at Purdue University, Drs. Stephen Samuels
    and George McCabe, begged to differ. They pointed out that those odds were based
    on a given person buying a single ticket for both lotteries and winning each time.
    But out of the millions and millions of people buying hundreds of millions of
    lottery tickets, the odds of a double winner somewhere in the country were dramatically
    different. One in 17 trillion? Nope—more like one in 30.

    the mystery of Michelle and the free groceries. But he knew a lot of other stuff
    about making luck in the grocery business. One of the early employees of Trader
    Joe’s when it was a small store in Los Angeles, he had some early successes—including
    fame as the guy who dreamed up All American Nut Butter. “Higher in protein than
    peanut butter and significantly less expensive—and we sold hundreds of thousands
    of pounds,” he told us, still proud all these years later.

    lunchtime staple—and he had the idea to make a substitute out of cottonseed. The
    development was complicated, but mostly it taught him the important lesson that
    “luck comes when you tap into a more innovative mind-set. Instead of just looking
    at what exists, you start thinking about what doesn’t exist and what *could* exist.”

    Rauch took. He came up with a plan to leapfrog the company three thousand miles
    away, expanding from California to the East Coast. Big risk? More like crazy stupid
    ridiculous risk. The owners and the CEO liked the idea, but the founder of the
    company, Joe Coulombe, who had since left, took him out to lunch to tell him not
    to sell his house in California when he moved to Boston. It couldn’t work. He
    would be back.

    model—with no counters or service or fresh deli—would fail. Boston was the capital
    of fresh fish—why would anybody buy frozen fish? “I came away from that dinner
    incredibly depressed. I even had our shirt supplier do a long-sleeved Hawaiian
    shirt to see what it would look like.”

    with the model he believed in. “It was slow, it was hard. It was a slog and always
    a struggle,” Rauch told us. “But that’s the way businesses go, and life, too.
    It’s not an overnight success many times. You can’t change who you are to be something
    else. You have to believe in yourself and have the courage to keep going.”

    for mathematicians. You just multiply the odds of something occurring times the
    expected payoff. So, for example, if you have a 10 percent shot at winning $1000,
    you multiply 10 percent (0.1) by 1000 and get 100\. Theoretically, you should
    be willing to put in up to a hundred bucks for the opportunity. But in real life,
    odds and potential payoffs aren’t always so clear—and emotions come into play,
    too. I’d see this problem as presenting a 90 percent likelihood that I’m going
    to lose whatever I put in. So maybe I’d risk five bucks. (This explains why I
    don’t have a career in private equity or venture capital.)
