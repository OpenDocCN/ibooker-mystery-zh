- en: In writing this book, Barnaby and I learned how much you need other people to
    help make luck. We are very grateful to Alice Martell, who is a terrific agent
    as well as a friend, advisor, and cheerleader. Jill Schwartzman is the editor
    every writer wants—smart and insightful and able to make every chapter a little
    better than it started. Our warmest thanks to the team at Dutton, including Amanda
    Walker, Carrie Swetonic, Liza Cassity, Becky Odell, Elina Vaysbeyn, Alice Dalrymple,
    and Marya Pasciuto, as well as Ivan Held, Christine Ball, and John Parsley. Thanks
    also to Marlene Ryan for help with logistics, to the wonderfully helpful librarians
    at the Yale Club, and to all our friends who have shared our excitement about
    learning to make luck.

    to experts in many fields, and we learned something from everyone we met. We are
    grateful to all of them. We’ve told many of their stories in these pages, so you
    already know the names—but extra special thanks for their time and openness to
    Martin Seligman, Susan Greenfield, Paul Zak, Helen Fisher, Arianna Huffington,
    Josh Groban, Doug Wick, Henry Jarecki, Bob Mankoff, and Deepak Chopra.

- en: Barnaby’s ideas on luck and risk have been developing for many years, and he
    has been shaped by conversations with great thinkers, including Ernst Mayr, Jonathan
    Sacks, Martin Nowak, Richard Dawkins, John Cacioppo, Jeff Epstein, Howard Nussbaum,
    Piet Hut, David Krakauer, John Bogle, John Templeton, Leon Cooperman, Freeman
    Dyson, Gerd Gigerenzer, Alex Kacelnik, Smitha Vishveshwara, John Brockman, Joi
    Ito, Ned Phelps, Linda Stone, Je Hyuk Lee, Judea Pearl, Michael Shermer, and Nolan
    Bushnell. The journey would not have been the same without their ideas and inspiration.

    everything to look up at the end of the day and and be surrounded by our terrific
    families. Very big hugs to our amazing children who bring us joy and make us smile
    every day. And to our spouses—my husband, Ron, and Barnaby’s wife, Michelle—we
    love you and thank you. You make us understand what it means to be lucky in love.
