- en: It was 2000, and the dot-com bubble had just burst. One morning, I woke up worth
    $78 million, with a villa in Florence and a 7,500-square-foot Cape Cod–style mansion
    on a bluff overlooking Newport Bay, and with a Ferrari, Porsche, Mercedes, BMW,
    and Range Rover in my multicar garage. I had just made a down payment on a 6,500-acre
    island in New Zealand. Yes, my own personal island, with four homes and beaches
    lapped by deep turquoise water and complete privacy. I thought I had left the
    poverty of my childhood far behind.

    like so many others who had believed in the limitless possibilities that Silicon

    overlooking Newport Bay on the market. No one was living in the house then. I
    was separated from my wife at the time, my daughter was away at college, and I
    was living in Silicon Valley as the CEO of a medical technology company a friend
    had founded. Reluctantly, I returned to the empty house to prepare it for sale
    and was met by all the harsh evidence that almost all of my dreams had failed.
    As I drove up, I saw the garden my wife had planted with such enthusiasm and care.
    What had once grown was now wilted and dead. Yellow-leaved azaleas and drooping
    camellias betrayed the lack of attention the garden had been getting from the
    gardener who had promised to check in. The house looked abandoned.

- en: What hurt most was who was absent from the house. Throughout the rooms were
    nails or picture hooks screwed into the walls, but without pictures. When my wife
    left, she took all the family photographs, and with them, any reminder that a
    family had lived in this house. In the central living room, above the mantel,
    there was a rectangular sun-shadow and a hook where a framed picture had hung.
    This had been our prized botanical print of iris bulbs by the Bavarian master
    Basilius Besler, which we had discovered in a tucked-away antiquarian print shop
    in Florence on one of our print-hunting adventures.

    back to painful or idealized memories of the past or leaning into the future toward

    my mind ran through a slideshow of a life that was now over. I passed my study
    with its grand navy-blue wing chair with brass studs, where I had drunk port and
    smoked cigars from my humidor with friends, the humidor that I had purchased at
    an auction for Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, of which I was the event chair.
    My name was engraved on a plaque on the top. When I’d sat in that chair and looked
    at the plaque as I got a cigar, I’d felt important. I sat in that chair again
    and rubbed my fingers across the plaque. I felt neither important nor powerful.

    memory floated up of my childhood. Poverty is a paradox: on the one hand, the

    home and flip through old copies of *Architectural Digest* that I found in the
    pile of books and magazines he gathered for artistic inspiration. My brother was
    an amazing artist, and he was always finding treasures to spark his creativity.
    When I saw a home whose details struck me as particularly cozy or dramatic—with
    a widow’s walk overlooking the sea, or a prominent hearth to warm family gatherings—I’d
    secretly tear out the page to add to my collection, which I kept in a green cardboard
    folder in my sock drawer. Of course, these magazines were from the 1960s and early
    ’70s, when the image of the perfect American family reigned without mercy over
    my childhood imagination. But still, over the years I compiled quite the archive
    of architectural details, so when Ruth asked me to envision the home I wanted,
    I had a vast store of images to draw from.

    after night, I had pictured myself there, feeling the bite of the sea breeze against
    my cheeks, tasting the snap of salt on my tongue, gazing into the depths of the
    swirling tides. In fact, I’d experienced the scene so vividly, with all my senses
    so fully engaged, that when I found myself standing on the widow’s walk of my
    Cape Cod–style mansion on a bluff overlooking Newport Bay in reality, I almost

    the person I wanted to be. My own father was not able to fill this role: a barely
    functioning binge drinker, he (and therefore my family) lived paycheck to paycheck
    when he did work. He’d be in a job for a few months, and we would start to feel
    almost safe, and then he would go on a binge, spend every penny, and come home
    drunk or just disappear for days. Invariably, the binge was almost always related
    to him losing his job for some reason unknown to any of us and him feeling afraid
    and ashamed to come home and face us, so he would start drinking. We moved often,
