    $78 million, with a villa in Florence and a 7,500-square-foot Cape Cod–style mansion
    on a bluff overlooking Newport Bay, and with a Ferrari, Porsche, Mercedes, BMW,
    and Range Rover in my multicar garage. I had just made a down payment on a 6,500-acre
    island in New Zealand. Yes, my own personal island, with four homes and beaches
    lapped by deep turquoise water and complete privacy. I thought I had left the
    poverty of my childhood far behind.

    was separated from my wife at the time, my daughter was away at college, and I
    was living in Silicon Valley as the CEO of a medical technology company a friend
    had founded. Reluctantly, I returned to the empty house to prepare it for sale

    gardener who had promised to check in. The house looked abandoned.

    there was a rectangular sun-shadow and a hook where a framed picture had hung.

    pile of books and magazines he gathered for artistic inspiration. My brother was
    an amazing artist, and he was always finding treasures to spark his creativity.
    When I saw a home whose details struck me as particularly cozy or dramatic—with
    a widow’s walk overlooking the sea, or a prominent hearth to warm family gatherings—I’d
    secretly tear out the page to add to my collection, which I kept in a green cardboard
    folder in my sock drawer. Of course, these magazines were from the 1960s and early
    ’70s, when the image of the perfect American family reigned without mercy over
    my childhood imagination. But still, over the years I compiled quite the archive
    of architectural details, so when Ruth asked me to envision the home I wanted,
    I had a vast store of images to draw from.

    it might take, without dealing with the problems of my old one. My life might
    have fallen apart externally, but internally, despite all emotional evidence to
    the contrary, I was still OK. It was possible to separate my consciousness from
    the negative emotional reactions the situation was causing in my mind and body.
    The only way for my nervous system to believe this was if I calmed down. I needed
    to relax, breathe deeply, and exhale, letting go of the tension before I could
    think clearly.

    of torn-up newspapers with a few apple slices inside. Possums are nocturnal, so
    I had to stay up and make sure she got inside. Then, wearing gardening gloves,
    I made sure none of her babies had been left in the nest or on the balcony behind
    the fire extinguisher. When I was confident everyone was accounted for, I loaded
    the trap into my car and drove it to a wooded area down the coast. I set the cage
    on the ground and opened the trap. Cautiously, the mother crawled out, sniffing
    along the ground, her bald tail curled above her, her babies tucked inside her
    pouch. In a few short weeks, the babies, who start life the size of a honeybee
    and can neither hear nor see, would be independent, venturing out on their own.
    Their instincts were powerful and reliable, and they did not question them. Whereas
    we humans, with our abnormally large brains and years of responding and adapting
    to our environment, need to fight for our natural wisdom, for our ability to hear
    and listen to our inner compass.'

    we picture owning a Ferrari, we envision ourselves cruising down the highway at
    top speed, relishing the devil-may-care freedom that we believe wealth gives us.
    We do not imagine the pain of having no one to share our adventure with. And when
    we picture a mansion to live in, we see a warm and vibrant scene of family life.
    We do not imagine our family fractured by a lack of intimacy, and ourselves alone
    facing the sale of our home. We imagine the things we want, but not the complexities
    they bring. We imagine the widow’s walk, but not the possums.
