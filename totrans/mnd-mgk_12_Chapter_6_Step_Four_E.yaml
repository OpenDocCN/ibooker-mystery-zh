    of Toronto was not easy. His mother, Kathleen, suffered from severe depression
    as well as physical ailments like rheumatoid arthritis and colitis. The child
    of alcoholics, she became addicted to pain medication and, in Carrey’s eyes, emotionally
    abandoned her children. Carrey’s father, Percy, was a gifted professional jazz
    musician who sold his saxophone to pay his wife’s hospital bills. Carrey described
    his father as an “insanely joyful, incredibly funny animated character that didn’t
    just tell a story—he became the characters. Everything I’ve done in my comedy
    career can be traced back to that origin. I love that guy so much.”

    reflected on how his father could have been a great comedian but his own lack
    of belief made it impossible. Instead, he chose safety and stability by getting
    a job as an accountant. Then, when Carrey was twelve, Percy was let go from that
    job and the family had to scramble to survive. “I learned many great lessons from
    my father,” Carrey said, “not the least of which was that you can fail at what
    you don’t want so you might as well take a chance on doing what you love.”

    camper and in a tent on his sister’s lawn in the country. Then they worked, as
    a family, as janitors at the Titan Wheel tire factory in Scarborough, where his
    coworkers intentionally defecated in the sinks due to feuds between the families.
    Carrey’s once excellent grades suffered, and he dropped out of high school at
    age sixteen to work full time. At first these childhood adversities led Carrey
    to feel a personal vendetta, to “blame the world” for his family’s financial and
    emotional woes. He became convinced that life was unfair and unforgiving.

    talking to himself in funny voices, and entertaining his family with impressions
    of neighbors and popular television stars. When his mother was in pain, he jumped
    up on her bed in his underwear and imitated a praying mantis until she was laughing
    so hard her belly hurt. He put on outrageous shows for dinner guests, and at age
    fifteen, Percy took him to appear at a hip underground comedy club in Toronto
    called Yuk Yuk’s. He bombed, but the experience set him on his path toward comedy
    stardom, ultimately inspiring him to move to Los Angeles to hone his craft full

    magic,” he told *Movieline* magazine in 1994\. He went on to describe how, before
    he was well known, he began a ritual of driving up Mulholland Drive every night,
    parking his car overlooking the city, stretching out his arms, and telling himself,
    “Everybody wants to work with me. I’m a really good actor. I have all kinds of
    great movie offers.” As he repeated these phrases and visualized them coming true
    in his mind, he started to convince himself he *did* have a couple of movies lined
    up, and as he drove down the hill, he affirmed to himself, “Movie offers are out
    there for me, I just don’t hear them yet.” As he drove back down the hill, he
    was filled with a sense of well-being, possibility, and even joy, having lived
    through many celebrations and successes in his imagination. Carrey has acknowledged
    that these affirmations served as antidotes to the negative beliefs he picked
    up from his family background.

    time he opened his wallet, the check reminded him of his intention and reinforced
    the narrative that he had embedded in his subconscious that he had already achieved
    everything he hoped for, just like Anula’s letters to herself that she kept in
    her purse. In the next three years, Carrey appeared in *Ace Ventura: Pet Detective*,

    consumed, and therefore the calories—significantly more than any other organ.
    Within the gray tissue crisscrossed with spongy coils there are over one hundred
    billion cells, and each of them makes over ten thousand connections within the
    vast network woven between brain cells. This web produces a thousand trillion
    synaptic connections, greater in number even than the stars in the universe. About

    any way possible, and it does so in a variety of ways. Have you ever noticed you
    can’t remember the name of the plucky kid from your favorite show in childhood?
    That’s because the brain developed not just learning mechanisms but also forgetting
    mechanisms that erase information it believes has become unnecessary because we
    have stopped recalling it. The brain also has a variety of shorthand techniques
    that it uses to encode and process information. Among these are what is known
    as the *iceberg phenomenon*, where it takes in only the essential information—the
    “tip of the iceberg”—while allowing the rest of the submerged iceberg to be suppressed.
    This process is also the source of all kinds of bias, from finding confirmation
    for our preexisting views to subconsciously choosing one type of person over another
    because of systemic conditioning. In some ways, our brains are not processing
    machines so much as predicting machines, using these shortcuts to be more efficient
    and consume less energy.

    information is just too heavy an energy lift. If your desire is so unfamiliar
    to the brain that fulfilling it would be a new experience requiring a tremendous
    amount of energy, your brain would just as soon look the other way. Often, this
    rejection takes the form of overlooking opportunity. If you are seeking a mate
    or a better job or a new place to live and feel stuck in a loop of failure and
    discouragement, it may be because your brain is literally not showing you examples
    of what you’re looking for because it does not yet know you care about them. The
    brain is only doing its job to make your system run smoothly, suppressing all
    the information it does not classify as salient. Other times, you may encounter
    what you believe you desire, but be surprised by a strong sensation of fear that
    is prompting you to push away what you thought you wanted. This, too, is not unusual,
    because fear is the brain’s way of guarding against the novelty of experiencing

    to receive our desire when it comes. We want our desire to be like the well-worn
    pair of slippers perfectly contoured to the shape of our feet, so the brain slides
    in easily without any resistance. This is the phenomenon of *cognitive ease*.
    The more the brain already knows our desire intimately down to the last detail,
    the less energy it will have to spend to welcome it into our lives. If we invest
    our energy up front in getting the brain accustomed to our goal ahead of time,
    it won’t have to balk at a large expense in the moment. Then, when our desire
    shows up to do business with the brain, it will already know, like, and trust

    (or preconscious), and an unconscious. The automatic parts of our nervous system,
    composed of the subconscious and unconscious, represent a part of our mind below
    our conscious awareness. We discussed previously the image of the mind as an iceberg,
    with the conscious mind (what we are aware of in ordinary waking consciousness)
    representing that which is above the water and constituting less than 10 percent
    of the mind, while the subconscious and unconscious make up the remaining 90 percent
    hidden below the surface of the water. At its simplest, the conscious mind means
    having awareness of internal and external existence. This awareness is based on
    the five senses, the qualia (the subjective interpretation of the senses), and
    the conscious access to memory and prior experience. Today, the definition often
    includes any kind of feeling, cognition, or perception.

    frightening because we are not seeing how it is working or what it is doing. We
    may even feel it is like a shadow government, pulling the strings of our lives
    behind the scenes. The sources of most of our reactions to people, places, and
    things are at a subconscious level, or just beneath the surface, and we do not

    to recognize our subconscious as the source of our intuition, our inner guidance,
    our creativity, and our resilience. In fact, it is our subconscious mind that

    the inner directive of our minds.

    whether from real or imagined experiences, teach our subconscious to associate
    the goals we wish to pursue with the biological reward systems of our bodies.
    In this state, our sense of self-consciousness is dialed down and we transcend
    the limiting beliefs of our mental habits and invite guidance from our deeper
    resources, such as our capacity for compassion or the creations of our imagination.
    Absorption in our inner vision is the state that connects us to creativity and
    clarifies our intention in our subconscious. The magic is that, as we go about
    our daily lives, while we may not be directly thinking about our inner intention
    with our conscious mind, the subconscious goes on processing it and attuning toward
    it.

    subconscious level, attending to manifesting our intention around the clock, employing

    it. Instead, we just let our subconscious make the call. The result is that there
    is often a disconnect between what we truly desire and what we actually do. Therefore,
    we must consciously create healthier habits of attention. The more attention we
    give a particular intention, the more we teach our filing clerk to prioritize
    it as an inner directive. This is the truth expressed by the phrase “Where attention

    the fight, flight, or freeze response to any perceived threat can be triggered
    with little to no oversight from the conscious mind. As we have considered in
    previous chapters, the problem is that the SNS is strictly reactive and hijacks
    everything else to get its agenda going because it is the thing that is protecting
    us and keeping us alive—at least, in its interpretation of its job, shaped by
    millennia of threat. Unfortunately, many of the things it does are not helping
    keep us alive at all, and certainly are not helping us to flourish in today’s
    world. As long as the SNS is curating the subconscious, the filing cabinet will
    be filled with fears, phobias, insecurities, and habitual beliefs that will be
    skewing our experience of life to the negative, the frightening, and the limited.
    Before we bring the light of awareness to our subconscious, we must see that it
    is really the domain of our survival fears and desires, the legacy of our evolutionary
    inheritance.

    tendencies to be stressed and anxious derive from the experiences of evolutionary
    predecessors that have been embedded in the subconscious and become the default
    software. As we learn how the subconscious works, this gives us the power to get
    information into the system. We begin to put the information we *choose* into

    we begin to break up the SNS’s unholy monopoly on our subconscious, freeing ourselves
    from the grip of survival fears that we find hard to ignore and that distract
    us from our deepest intentions. Using practices of suggestibility and conscious
    repetition, we limit the SNS’s own direct path to the subconscious and gain the

    PNS, our executive control areas, change how we react to the world not only on

    is defined as a state of complete engagement with a task accompanied by a lessening

    action, and we feel that the skills we possess match the challenge we face.

    inner critic’s needling voice dies away, our habitual worries and self-consciousness
    fade, and we feel at one with the moment, with ourselves, and with our environment.
    We feel in control, no matter how chaotic the factors may be. Time seems to fly,
    space seems to bend to our will, our actions are guided from a crystalline sense
    of direction. Artists in the fever of creation, athletes in the zone, a scientist
    in the process of discovering an innovation—these are our common images of flow.
    But flow can also arise in more ordinary situations, like completing a task at
    work or, during leisure time, pulling weeds in the garden. When we are in flow,
    we can become so lost in a task that we don’t notice the day is over, we’ve eaten
    nothing, and we’re neither tired nor bored. Our work feels effortless when, in
    reality, the effort we have produced is tremendous. The flow experience often

    an abiding feeling of joy or rapture that makes life worth living.'

    general hypothesis that periods of flow are characterized by lowered activity
    in the frontal lobes that produce the sense of conscious control. Much of the
    behavior we perform in a flow state seems to be from the bottom up, initiated
    automatically from the subconscious. This accounts for the experiences of so many
    high performers who describe practicing their skills for years only to forget
    all of their abilities in the moment of performance and just “go with the flow.”

    state, the brain’s central executive network actively inhibits our experience
    of stimuli that are not relevant to our task, as well as any thoughts that might
    distract us. We also experience lowered activity in the default mode network,
    the part of our brain that wanders and worries when we are not focused on an external
    cognitive task. This means that in the flow state there is a diminishment of self-referential
    thinking, and therefore our stress levels go down because we are not self-consciously
    critiquing our every move. Flow also enlists the brain’s dopamine reward system,
    which tends to coincide with feelings of optimism, hope, possibility, and a feeling
    of being highly motivated, as well as reducing feelings of fatigue and discomfort.
    Where the slot machine or phone notification provides a hit of dopamine, flow
    immerses us in a sustained experience of it. The paradox of flow is that you are
    going toward the goal but the goal is irrelevant. The promise of rewards inspires
    the sense of relentless dedication to complete what we need to do, but the satisfaction
    of one-pointed concentration and the absorption in the process are complete in

    we give our imagination free rein to carry us wholly into our inner experience
    of our intention. It is the very act of paying such careful attention that liberates
    our mind to inhabit the inner vision, just as it liberates the high performer
    to respond to their task with grace, coordination, and precision.

    and subconscious minds in service of our intention. In flow, we have a special
    kind of access to the deeper resources of our subconscious and can draw upon them
    more directly. We can also seek this kind of VIP access to the subconscious via
    the techniques of hypnosis, which utilize many of the same regions in the brain.

    we are essentially hypnotizing our minds into recognizing that our intention is
    important. If we go on YouTube, we can find countless examples of performance
    hypnotists putting audience members into a trance, then guiding them to forget
    their names, laugh hysterically, collapse into sleep, or feel completely drunk
    while remaining absolutely sober. Neuroscientists have measured the effects of
    hypnosis on the brain and made several telling discoveries. Fundamentally, hypnosis
    is the practice of changing the way we use our minds to control perception and
    the body itself. Like flow, it works by a state of complete absorption.

- en: 'Using functional magnetic imaging, which measures brain activity by detecting
    changes in blood flow, researchers at Stanford University monitored the brains
    of patients under hypnosis and observed several distinct phenomena. First, a decrease
    in activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate, part of the brain’s salience network,
    was evident. The reason for this is that in hypnosis, the state of absorption
    is so thorough that one’s attention is focused on the task, with no need to scan
    the inner and outer environments for further salient stimuli. Further, an increase
    in connections between two other areas of the brain—the dorsolateral prefrontal
    cortex and the insula—were noted. These areas working in tandem suggests a connection
    formed between the brain and body, giving the brain a greater ability to respond
    to and even exercise some control over the sensations the body is sending it.
    Finally, reduced connections between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the
    default mode network were found. This decrease in functional connectivity likely
    represents a decoupling of the subject’s actions from their conscious awareness
    of those actions. At this point, the subject is no longer thinking about what
    they are doing: they have entered a state beyond worry or self-conscious commentary
    and they are simply *doing*.'

    subject is highly susceptible to suggestion from the hypnotist or, in the case
    of self-hypnosis, from themselves. They can more easily engage in activities that
    might cause a defensive reaction in ordinary life without the self-consciousness
    that costs so much brain energy. In other words, hypnosis allows us to be completely
    absorbed in the object of our attention, gain heightened control over our bodies
    and feelings, and get out of our own way so that we allow the power of our subconscious
    to work freely. When we deliberately embed an intention in our minds through repeated
    visualization, we are making use of the same physiological pathways as hypnosis.

    of the placebo effect. We have all heard incredible stories about patients with
    chronic illness or pain who were given medicine promising miraculous results.
    The patients beat their afflictions and healed completely, only to learn they
    had been taking nothing more than a sugar pill. Simply taking the pill signaled
    to their bodies a belief in the possibility of healing, which in turn caused their
    bodies to change on a genetic level, thereby defeating the disease. Similar to
    the process of hypnosis, the placebo effect arises because the patient’s consciousness
    is communicating with the subconscious and autonomic nervous system and using
    the mind to reshape their body on a cellular level. The intention of the conscious
    mind to heal due to the patient’s belief in the possibility of healing becomes
    installed in their subconscious, which can alter the way genes produce cells.
    Then the patient’s body, mind, and heart accept this thought as reality, believe
    in it emotionally, and eventually come to express it physically by overcoming
    their symptoms.

    the volume of the outside world, and by doing so diminish incoming distractions
    from the senses. This includes tuning down false or distorted beliefs that stand
    as obstacles to healing and realization. There is also a significant reduction
    in the activity of the default mode network, which is normally responsible for
    our self-conscious critique of whatever we are doing. And finally, the positive
    emotions that flood our bodies as we focus activate the reward centers in the
    brain, so we become more alert to the possibility of our intention coming true,
    and more willing to endure discomfort to get it. As a result, consciousness can
    inhabit a space that is beyond the body, physical environment, and even time itself,
    and so the inner intention can become more and more of a reality.

    cofounder of the Pachamama Alliance, through our mutual friend, the author Neal
    Rogin. Lynne described to me how, before she meets with a potential donor, she
    writes out her purpose and intended results for the conversation. Then she lights
    a candle. Whether she is raising money for the Pachamama Alliance to preserve
    the Sacred Headwaters of the Amazon, the Hunger Project, or the Nobel Women’s
    Initiative, she calls to mind her overarching intention to “facilitate the reallocation
    of financial resources from fear to love, from destruction to nourishing our communities,
    our families, and our world.” As she contemplates the candle, she clarifies her
    awareness that she will have the great privilege of speaking to another human
    being, tuning in to who they really are and the generosity in their hearts, and
    inviting them to partner with her, rather than manipulating them in any way. From
    her own private sacred space, she communes with the spirit of the potential donor
    and envisions the conversation through the lens of her heart, asking them if they
    would like their money to be a conduit for their love. She visualizes the person’s
    answer, whether they wholeheartedly accept her invitation or decline in favor
    of putting their money to another purpose. Either way, she pictures them being
    completely satisfied and fulfilled by their response. This way, if the donor decides
    not to participate, Lynne is not disappointed; she simply “blesses and releases
    them.”

    our intention into the deeper levels of our minds. Some are ceremonial, like Lynne’s,
    and others are more ordinary. For example, many of us write out our intention
    and place it somewhere we will see it every day, such as on the bathroom mirror,
    on the dashboard of our car, or in our wallet. Or we can recall Anula’s practice
    of writing herself letters and carrying them with her. Every time we see the paper
    with our intention, we can repeat our visualization of achieving our goal, calling
    into our minds, bodies, and hearts the wonderful feelings we will experience when
    our goal becomes reality. As we practice remembering our desired result over and
    over again, our repeated intention to experience the fulfillment of our desires
    is giving our attention (and therefore our subconscious) some velocity to influence
    the outcome.

    beliefs installed in his subconscious during his childhood that were obstacles
    to him manifesting his desires. Once he was aware of them, he could intentionally
    offer his subconscious corrective beliefs, which he embedded by means of affirmation,
    visualization, and repetitive ritualized reminders sitting in his car up on Mulholland
    Drive. Through associating his intentions with strong positive emotions experienced
    in the present, he was redirecting his subconscious to pay attention to his desired
    outcomes and alerting his salience network to scan for opportunities to realize
    his goals. Evidence confirming the cruelty, randomness, and injustice of the world
    became less relevant to his mind and made way for hopeful indications of success,
    synchronicities that advanced his professional dreams, and perseverance in the
    face of inevitable setbacks.

    his visualizations (and the neurotransmitters released by these experiences of
    strong positive emotions) with the fierce work ethic he demonstrated in refining
    his gifts at the comedy clubs. The positive emotions he lived through in his mental
    rehearsal signaled to his brain that the experiences he desired were worthy of
    attention and that mental resources should be devoted to pursuing them. In a sense,
    he was hypnotizing himself *out* of the grasp his painful childhood experiences
    exercised over him and *into* the new reality of his future success. His ritual
    of looking out over Los Angeles and rehearsing his success affected his brain
    the same way the medical ritual of visiting the hospital and being given a pill
    affects a patient benefiting from the placebo effect. As a result, when success
    did indeed come, Carrey’s conscious mind had already lived through it as an experiential
    reality through mental rehearsal and was primed to receive it without fear or
    resistance.

    even when our external circumstances (and our own minds) seem to be conspiring
