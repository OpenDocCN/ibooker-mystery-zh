    of Toronto was not easy. His mother, Kathleen, suffered from severe depression
    as well as physical ailments like rheumatoid arthritis and colitis. The child
    of alcoholics, she became addicted to pain medication and, in Carrey’s eyes, emotionally
    abandoned her children. Carrey’s father, Percy, was a gifted professional jazz
    musician who sold his saxophone to pay his wife’s hospital bills. Carrey described
    his father as an “insanely joyful, incredibly funny animated character that didn’t
    just tell a story—he became the characters. Everything I’ve done in my comedy
    career can be traced back to that origin. I love that guy so much.”

- en: In his commencement address at Maharishi International University in 2014, Carrey
    reflected on how his father could have been a great comedian but his own lack
    of belief made it impossible. Instead, he chose safety and stability by getting
    a job as an accountant. Then, when Carrey was twelve, Percy was let go from that
    job and the family had to scramble to survive. “I learned many great lessons from
    my father,” Carrey said, “not the least of which was that you can fail at what
    you don’t want so you might as well take a chance on doing what you love.”

- en: After Percy lost his job at age fifty-one, Carrey’s family lived in a Volkswagen
    camper and in a tent on his sister’s lawn in the country. Then they worked, as
    a family, as janitors at the Titan Wheel tire factory in Scarborough, where his
    coworkers intentionally defecated in the sinks due to feuds between the families.
    Carrey’s once excellent grades suffered, and he dropped out of high school at
    age sixteen to work full time. At first these childhood adversities led Carrey
    to feel a personal vendetta, to “blame the world” for his family’s financial and
    emotional woes. He became convinced that life was unfair and unforgiving.

    so hard her belly hurt. He put on outrageous shows for dinner guests, and at age
    fifteen, Percy took him to appear at a hip underground comedy club in Toronto

    magic,” he told *Movieline* magazine in 1994\. He went on to describe how, before
    he was well known, he began a ritual of driving up Mulholland Drive every night,
    parking his car overlooking the city, stretching out his arms, and telling himself,
    “Everybody wants to work with me. I’m a really good actor. I have all kinds of
    great movie offers.” As he repeated these phrases and visualized them coming true
    in his mind, he started to convince himself he *did* have a couple of movies lined
    up, and as he drove down the hill, he affirmed to himself, “Movie offers are out
    there for me, I just don’t hear them yet.” As he drove back down the hill, he
    was filled with a sense of well-being, possibility, and even joy, having lived
    through many celebrations and successes in his imagination. Carrey has acknowledged
    that these affirmations served as antidotes to the negative beliefs he picked
    up from his family background.

    the narrative that he had embedded in his subconscious that he had already achieved
    everything he hoped for, just like Anula’s letters to herself that she kept in
    her purse. In the next three years, Carrey appeared in *Ace Ventura: Pet Detective*,

    that it uses to encode and process information. Among these are what is known

    “tip of the iceberg”—while allowing the rest of the submerged iceberg to be suppressed.
    This process is also the source of all kinds of bias, from finding confirmation
    for our preexisting views to subconsciously choosing one type of person over another

    of what you’re looking for because it does not yet know you care about them. The

    the goals we wish to pursue with the biological reward systems of our bodies.
    In this state, our sense of self-consciousness is dialed down and we transcend
    the limiting beliefs of our mental habits and invite guidance from our deeper
    resources, such as our capacity for compassion or the creations of our imagination.
    Absorption in our inner vision is the state that connects us to creativity and
    clarifies our intention in our subconscious. The magic is that, as we go about
    our daily lives, while we may not be directly thinking about our inner intention
    with our conscious mind, the subconscious goes on processing it and attuning toward

    is that, because of the evolutionary structure of the brain, the SNS does not
    have to go through any neural processing in order to gain access to it. Therefore,
    the fight, flight, or freeze response to any perceived threat can be triggered
    with little to no oversight from the conscious mind. As we have considered in
    previous chapters, the problem is that the SNS is strictly reactive and hijacks
    everything else to get its agenda going because it is the thing that is protecting
    us and keeping us alive—at least, in its interpretation of its job, shaped by
    millennia of threat. Unfortunately, many of the things it does are not helping
    keep us alive at all, and certainly are not helping us to flourish in today’s
    world. As long as the SNS is curating the subconscious, the filing cabinet will
    be filled with fears, phobias, insecurities, and habitual beliefs that will be
    skewing our experience of life to the negative, the frightening, and the limited.
    Before we bring the light of awareness to our subconscious, we must see that it

    predecessors that have been embedded in the subconscious and become the default
    software. As we learn how the subconscious works, this gives us the power to get
    information into the system. We begin to put the information we *choose* into

    state, the brain’s central executive network actively inhibits our experience
    of stimuli that are not relevant to our task, as well as any thoughts that might
    distract us. We also experience lowered activity in the default mode network,
    the part of our brain that wanders and worries when we are not focused on an external
    cognitive task. This means that in the flow state there is a diminishment of self-referential
    thinking, and therefore our stress levels go down because we are not self-consciously
    critiquing our every move. Flow also enlists the brain’s dopamine reward system,
    which tends to coincide with feelings of optimism, hope, possibility, and a feeling
    of being highly motivated, as well as reducing feelings of fatigue and discomfort.
    Where the slot machine or phone notification provides a hit of dopamine, flow
    immerses us in a sustained experience of it. The paradox of flow is that you are
    going toward the goal but the goal is irrelevant. The promise of rewards inspires

    changes in blood flow, researchers at Stanford University monitored the brains
    of patients under hypnosis and observed several distinct phenomena. First, a decrease
    in activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate, part of the brain’s salience network,
    was evident. The reason for this is that in hypnosis, the state of absorption
    is so thorough that one’s attention is focused on the task, with no need to scan
    the inner and outer environments for further salient stimuli. Further, an increase
    in connections between two other areas of the brain—the dorsolateral prefrontal
    cortex and the insula—were noted. These areas working in tandem suggests a connection
    formed between the brain and body, giving the brain a greater ability to respond
    to and even exercise some control over the sensations the body is sending it.
    Finally, reduced connections between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the
    default mode network were found. This decrease in functional connectivity likely
    represents a decoupling of the subject’s actions from their conscious awareness

    is communicating with the subconscious and autonomic nervous system and using
    the mind to reshape their body on a cellular level. The intention of the conscious
    mind to heal due to the patient’s belief in the possibility of healing becomes
    installed in their subconscious, which can alter the way genes produce cells.

    in the activity of the default mode network, which is normally responsible for
    our self-conscious critique of whatever we are doing. And finally, the positive
    emotions that flood our bodies as we focus activate the reward centers in the
    brain, so we become more alert to the possibility of our intention coming true,

- en: I was introduced to Lynne Twist, founder of the Soul of Money Institute and
    cofounder of the Pachamama Alliance, through our mutual friend, the author Neal
    Rogin. Lynne described to me how, before she meets with a potential donor, she
    writes out her purpose and intended results for the conversation. Then she lights
    a candle. Whether she is raising money for the Pachamama Alliance to preserve
    the Sacred Headwaters of the Amazon, the Hunger Project, or the Nobel Women’s
    Initiative, she calls to mind her overarching intention to “facilitate the reallocation
    of financial resources from fear to love, from destruction to nourishing our communities,
    our families, and our world.” As she contemplates the candle, she clarifies her
    awareness that she will have the great privilege of speaking to another human
    being, tuning in to who they really are and the generosity in their hearts, and
    inviting them to partner with her, rather than manipulating them in any way. From
    her own private sacred space, she communes with the spirit of the potential donor
    and envisions the conversation through the lens of her heart, asking them if they
    would like their money to be a conduit for their love. She visualizes the person’s
    answer, whether they wholeheartedly accept her invitation or decline in favor
    of putting their money to another purpose. Either way, she pictures them being
    completely satisfied and fulfilled by their response. This way, if the donor decides
    not to participate, Lynne is not disappointed; she simply “blesses and releases
    them.”

  zh: 我通过我们的共同朋友、作家尼尔·罗金认识了林恩·特威斯特，灵魂财富研究所的创始人和帕查马玛联盟的共同创始人。林恩向我描述了在与潜在捐助者会面之前，她会写下自己的目的和对话的预期结果。然后她点燃一支蜡烛。无论她是为帕查马玛联盟筹集资金以保护亚马逊的神圣水源、为饥饿项目筹款，还是为诺贝尔女性倡议筹款，她都会回忆起她的总体意图：“促进财务资源从恐惧转向爱，从破坏转向滋养我们的社区、家庭和世界。”在思考蜡烛的过程中，她澄清自己意识到自己将有机会与另一位人类交谈，倾听他们真正的自我和心中的慷慨，并邀请他们与她合作，而不是以任何方式操控他们。从她自己私密的神圣空间出发，她与潜在捐助者的灵魂交流，通过她的内心视角展望对话，询问他们是否希望他们的资金成为爱的媒介。她想象着那个人的回答，无论是全心全意接受她的邀请，还是选择将钱用于其他目的。无论哪种方式，她都想象他们对自己的回应感到完全满意和充实。这样，如果捐助者决定不参与，林恩也不会感到失望；她只是“祝福并释放他们”。
- en: There are countless rituals, rites, and practices we can make use of to embed
    our intention into the deeper levels of our minds. Some are ceremonial, like Lynne’s,
    and others are more ordinary. For example, many of us write out our intention
    and place it somewhere we will see it every day, such as on the bathroom mirror,
    on the dashboard of our car, or in our wallet. Or we can recall Anula’s practice
    of writing herself letters and carrying them with her. Every time we see the paper
    with our intention, we can repeat our visualization of achieving our goal, calling
    into our minds, bodies, and hearts the wonderful feelings we will experience when
    our goal becomes reality. As we practice remembering our desired result over and
    over again, our repeated intention to experience the fulfillment of our desires
    is giving our attention (and therefore our subconscious) some velocity to influence
    the outcome.

  zh: 我们可以利用无数的仪式、典礼和实践将我们的意图嵌入我们内心的更深层次。有些是仪式性的，比如林恩的，而其他则更为普通。例如，我们中的许多人会将自己的意图写出来，并放在每天都能看到的地方，比如浴室镜子、车的仪表盘或钱包里。或者，我们可以回想阿努拉写信给自己并随身携带的做法。每次看到写有我们意图的纸张时，我们都可以重复想象实现目标的情景，呼唤心灵、身体和内心在目标实现时所体验到的美好感觉。随着我们一次又一次地练习回忆我们想要的结果，我们反复的意图去体验愿望的实现，给予我们的注意力（因此也给予我们的潜意识）一些动能，以影响结果。

    beliefs installed in his subconscious during his childhood that were obstacles
    to him manifesting his desires. Once he was aware of them, he could intentionally
    offer his subconscious corrective beliefs, which he embedded by means of affirmation,
    visualization, and repetitive ritualized reminders sitting in his car up on Mulholland
    Drive. Through associating his intentions with strong positive emotions experienced
    in the present, he was redirecting his subconscious to pay attention to his desired
    outcomes and alerting his salience network to scan for opportunities to realize
    his goals. Evidence confirming the cruelty, randomness, and injustice of the world
    became less relevant to his mind and made way for hopeful indications of success,
    synchronicities that advanced his professional dreams, and perseverance in the
    face of inevitable setbacks.

- en: Carrey combined the sense of empowerment, gratitude, and joy he received from
    his visualizations (and the neurotransmitters released by these experiences of
    strong positive emotions) with the fierce work ethic he demonstrated in refining
    his gifts at the comedy clubs. The positive emotions he lived through in his mental
    rehearsal signaled to his brain that the experiences he desired were worthy of
    attention and that mental resources should be devoted to pursuing them. In a sense,
    he was hypnotizing himself *out* of the grasp his painful childhood experiences
    exercised over him and *into* the new reality of his future success. His ritual
    of looking out over Los Angeles and rehearsing his success affected his brain
    the same way the medical ritual of visiting the hospital and being given a pill
    affects a patient benefiting from the placebo effect. As a result, when success
    did indeed come, Carrey’s conscious mind had already lived through it as an experiential
    reality through mental rehearsal and was primed to receive it without fear or
    resistance.

    exist outside of ourselves, but the reality is that within each of us is a superpower
    that allows us to imagine amazing possibilities for ourselves, and that is the
    power of visualization. When I first learned these techniques from Ruth in the
    magic shop, it was before the term visualization was in common practice or the
    concept of neuroplasticity was understood. What has been learned since that time
    is how powerful visualization can be when practiced diligently and with an open

    It is a conscious practice diligently cultivated with care. Rarely do we get what
    we want right away. Instead, we must stick with it, often through thick and thin,
    even when our external circumstances (and our own minds) seem to be conspiring
    to keep us from achieving our goals. And there is almost always a moment when
    we must enlist the support of others to help us get there. For this reason, we
    turn in our next chapter to Step Five: Pursue Your Goal Passionately, in which
    we will learn how the rest-and-digest response lets us connect consciously with
    others, and how to become the kind of person others want to help through aligning
    our intention to a higher purpose.'
