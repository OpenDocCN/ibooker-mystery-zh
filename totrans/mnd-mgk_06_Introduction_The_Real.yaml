    to fix our problems and make us whole: a winning lottery ticket, a wise guide
    who knows all the answers, a guru, a guardian angel, or some magical being, force,
    energy, or genie sitting out there in the universe who will make everything work
    out for us. For years, I longed to believe this, too. I thought there was a stern
    cosmic parent tracking all our actions and deciding if we were worthy to receive
    our dream house or to meet our soulmate or to be cured of cancer. As a neuroscientist
    and physician, I know today that we have no proof of such a force or being but
    we have a great deal of scientific evidence of the power of our own minds to produce
    changes in our lives that may at first appear impossible. This is the practice

    go any further, here is what I mean by the term: *manifesting* is defining an
    intention such that it gets embedded into our subconscious, which functions below
    the level of consciousness. By doing so, we activate brain networks associated
    with goal orientation that make an intention important, salient, or noteworthy.
    In practice, this means that regardless of whether or not that intention is present
    on a conscious level, brain mechanisms that remain focused on the goal are activated
    around the clock. Our inner intention now guides our life. By using our inner
    power to tap the vast resources of our own brain, we gradually decrease the impact
    of our external environment and begin living from our deepest intentions.'

    from the belief that there is an external source for solving your problems, and
    that this external source is what is manifesting in your life. If you want to
    lead a rich, meaningful, and prosperous life, you do not have to appease any power
    beyond yourself. You simply must believe that the source of your well-being and
    success is nothing other than the power of your own mind. The reality is that
    the same mind that creates the obstacles to the life you want is also the source
    of the intention that will make the life that you want real. This is the real
    secret.

    I grew up in poverty, with an alcoholic father and a chronically depressed and
    suicidal mother. I had the feeling that life was a punishment or a curse or, possibly
    worst of all, a random and chaotic mess without rhyme or reason. Maybe you, too,
    struggle to find meaning in the events of what feels like a haphazard existence,
    or you wonder why you and your loved ones have to suffer when there is no good
    reason to and you feel powerless to help. These struggles begin to limit your
    vision of what is possible and make it more and more narrow.

    believe I could effect any meaningful change. This is so often the case when we
    experience trauma: the pain and shock of the traumatic experience take on an exaggerated
    authority in our minds that is difficult to challenge and frightening to confront.
    This pain is powerful enough to alter not only our own genes but, as researchers
    in the field of epigenetics have discovered, the genes of subsequent generations.
    Our minds and bodies organize around preparations to prevent a similar trauma
    from happening in the future, and in the process, our consciousness becomes caught
    in reacting to a frightening and unreliable external world rather than envisioning
    the changes we can make. In the process, we give away the energy, attention, and
    focus we possess to make a real difference in our own lives; we are distracted
    away from our own power. Without knowing it, we trade our innate self-agency for
    magical thinking. It’s a raw deal.'

    other human beings in this world are treated with greater injustice, on both the
    individual and systemic levels. The societies they live in have created structural
    roadblocks that limit their ability to manifest, whether due to their race, social
    class, religion, sexual orientation, gender expression, or other arbitrary criteria.
    Still other people are afflicted by serious illnesses of the body and the mind
    and can find little relief from their suffering, which also affects their belief
    in their ability to manifest. Manifesting is not a cure or a fix for all suffering.
    Like all human activity, it can be limited by countless factors beyond our control
    and reality has the final say, regardless of our intention. That being said, if
    there is a possibility of change, using the techniques of manifesting will more
    likely than not help bring it about.

    practiced an attitude of “long-term nonspecific optimism.” He did not know if
    or when he would be liberated and he recognized that his situation was outside
    of his control: to fight his captors was to possibly be killed or to lose the
    will to live from despair. Instead, his conscious practice of optimism allowed
    him to remain hopeful that his circumstances could change. He used the power of
    his mind to keep his belief in the possibility of freedom alive. It gave him resilience.
    And when he was released, his attitude of optimism helped him not to focus on
    the past but to look forward to future possibilities.'

    with the world, and living a good life. By practicing it, we cultivate *dispositional
    optimism*, defined as a generalized tendency to expect good outcomes across important
    life domains. Research has shown a staggering number of health benefits associated
    with dispositional optimism, from improvements in cardiovascular health to how
    quickly wounds heal to slower disease progression. Where some may believe that
    the only measure of a successful manifestation is the material results it delivers,
    I consider this view to be misguided. The true gift of visualizing our intentions
    again and again is to go through life with a buoyant sense that things will work
    out for us, which liberates us to be both responsive and resilient no matter what
    our external circumstances bring.

    associate today with manifesting derives from the Vedic scriptures of the Hindu
    tradition. The Mundaka Upanishad, for example, states, “Whatever world a man of
    pure understanding envisages in his mind and whatever desires he cherishes, that
    world he conquers and those desires he obtains” (3.2.10). The Buddha similarly
    commented on the powerful ability of thoughts to shape our experience of the world

    from a wide variety of religious and philosophical sources, including alchemy,
    New England transcendentalism, the Christian gospels, and Hinduism to formulate
    the notion of the “Law of Attraction.” At its core, the Law of Attraction is the
    belief that our thoughts determine the nature of the experiences that come into
    our lives: positive thoughts bring positive experiences and negative thoughts
    bring negative ones. New Thought served as the foundation for much of the popular
    literature on manifesting in Western culture, from Napoleon Hill’s *Think and
    Grow Rich* (1937) to Norman Vincent Peale’s *The Power of Positive Thinking* (1952)
    to perhaps the most well-known and notorious, Rhonda Byrne’s *The Secret* (2006).'

    by becoming rich, living in a mansion, and driving an expensive car, you will
    create happiness and find the behavioral changes that are required to realize
    our desires. And perhaps most damaging, it has spread the idea that the painful
    and unjust circumstances we experience are entirely the result of our own thinking.

    manifestation as a path to a life of meaning and purpose and, at the end of the

    tarot cards, and belief in the power of crystals, full of pseudoscience and platitudes.
    Until recently, it was not possible to scientifically study the concrete processes
    by which the brain turns intention into reality. But significant developments
    in imaging have revolutionized our ability to watch the brain transform on a cellular,
    genetic, and even molecular level. We can now speak about manifestation in terms
    of cognitive neuroscience and the function of large-scale brain networks. This
    has allowed us to demonstrate that manifesting is neither a get-rich-quick scheme
    nor a misguided wish-fulfillment system but is part of the brain’s extraordinary
    ability to change, heal, and remake itself, known as *neuroplasticity*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Neuroplasticity is the umbrella term for the brain’s ability to modify, change,
    and adapt both structure and function throughout life and in response to experience,
    as well as through repetition and intention, enabling the brain to form new circuits
    and to prune away old ones that no longer serve us. By redirecting our attention,
    we can literally change our brains, creating more gray matter in the very areas
    that help us learn, help us perform, and allow us to manifest. As the brain adapts,
    it makes alterations that can produce dramatic and positive effects on everything
    from Parkinson’s disease to chronic pain to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
    (ADHD). And the same neuroplasticity is how we change our brains using intention
    and practice to manifest the reality we envision.

- en: Manifesting is essentially the process of intentionally embedding the thoughts
    and images of the life we desire into our subconscious. We are all manifesting
    intentions in an untrained and uninformed way already, and the results are often
    haphazard, vague, and unfocused. To manifest consciously, we must learn how to
    reclaim and direct the power of our attention and understand the physiological
    mechanisms that allow us to direct that attention, as well as the obstacles and
    false beliefs that limit our power to do so. When we consciously direct our attention
    toward our desired goals, those goals become important to the brain. The way our
    goals get embedded is through a process called *value tagging*, the brain’s way
    of deciding what is significant enough to be imprinted at the deepest levels of
    the subconscious. When we practice visualization, we conjure powerful positive
    emotions, and these cue the *selective attention system* to tag the goals we desire
    as highly valuable and associate them with our reward system. Visualization works
    because, amazingly, the brain does not distinguish between an actual physical
    experience and one that is intensely imagined.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once the goal is embedded in our subconscious, our brain works like a bloodhound
    seeking opportunities to bring it about in reality, putting the full force of
    our conscious and subconscious minds behind the search. As opportunities arise,
    we notice them and respond, taking the necessary action to further our goal. We
    repeat this process of embedding our intention many, many times. Once we have
    done everything we can to manifest our goal, we must accept that is all we can
    do and no longer have attachment to the outcome. Manifestation has its own timeline
    that may or may not correspond with ours. Also, the reality is that not all of
    our goals will manifest, and often there are many reasons why that is the case,
    which are not apparent at the time.

    I had as a child that would change my life forever. Growing up in poverty and
    stuck in a painful family situation in the High Desert of California, I believed
    I was under a kind of curse that would keep my life small and at the mercy of
    my circumstances. Then one summer day while my parents were arguing, I got on
    my bike and rode as fast and as far as I could from my house and, with dust in
    my mouth, wandered into a magic shop. I met a kind woman named Ruth, who wore
    a blue muumuu and looked up from the paperback she was reading. Her glasses were
    perched on her nose and held by a chain around her neck. Ruth gave me an incredibly
    radiant smile. The very nature of her smile made me feel OK: she made me feel
    safe. She told me it was her son’s shop, and she didn’t know anything about magic.
    After we spoke for about twenty minutes, Ruth indicated that she would be in town
    for six weeks that summer and offered to teach me about another type of magic
    if I came to the shop every day. Over those six weeks, Ruth fed me a bottomless
    supply of Chips Ahoy! cookies and taught me what she called “real magic”: techniques
    I could use to relax my body, tame my mind, open my heart, and clarify and visualize
    my intention. Those happy hours I spent in the back room of the magic shop sitting
    across from Ruth in a metal chair on the brown shag carpet were my first experiences
    of neuroplasticity. Her kindness and attention rewired my brain.'

    my mind, but I learned I could replace the negative thoughts with positive, self-affirming
    ones; I could let go of the voice that told me “People like you never amount to
    anything” and replace it with the voice of the person I wanted to be living the
    life I wanted to live. I discovered I had a brain that could be reshaped to form
    new pathways through repetition and intention toward my own healing. With her

    I became a physician and neurosurgeon. Buoyed by Ruth’s kindness and care, I devoted
    myself to my vision of the future I wanted, and this was the first step in truly
    manifesting into reality the life I desired. I went from taking all my cues from

    found it disheartening that this magic that is within every human being has been
    so frequently misunderstood, commodified, or presented as something only certain
    people can access. While manifesting is commonly understood in our culture as
    a way of gaining great wealth and possessions, available only to the lucky few,
    I see it as a daily practice of well-being that promotes thriving, wholeness,
    and an openhearted engagement with our world. And where the so-called prosperity

    I am here to tell you that it is in fact our ability to direct our attention.
