  zh: 巴纳比在一个雨天赶到我们周三的会议时，心里一直在担心保持健康。由于他有两个小女儿，细菌成为了其中的一部分游戏规则。家里一个人感冒了，把病毒传给了下一个人，再传给下一个人——这是许多学龄前孩子家长都深有体会的无尽循环。

    our control. I told Barnaby about a slim forty-five-year-old woman I met who ran
    marathons and never smoked and was diagnosed with advanced-stage lung cancer.

- en: Ultimately, there probably *is* a way to explain it—researchers continue closing
    in on more and more discoveries of the genetic and biological underpinnings of
    disease. But until science has a firmer grasp of them, most of us are frightened
    by the seeming randomness of how disease strikes. A healthy nonsmoker getting
    lung cancer? How can you control the bad luck that seems uncontrollable? As we
    look for causes of the unknown, we’re not that far removed from the ancient Roman
    poet Lucretius, who thought people got sickened by “seeds” in the air, and ancient
    Greeks like Hippocrates, who blamed an imbalance of the four humors. Some early
    Chinese physicians thought illness came from spirits who had been angered, and
    even now many religions believe in divine causes and cures.

  zh: 最终，或许*确实*有办法解释这一切——研究人员不断深入探索与疾病相关的基因和生物学基础。但在科学对此有更牢固的掌握之前，我们大多数人都会对疾病的随机性感到恐惧。一个健康的非吸烟者得肺癌？你怎么能控制这种似乎无法控制的坏运气呢？当我们寻找未知的原因时，我们距离古罗马诗人卢克莱修并不遥远，他认为人类生病是因为空气中有“种子”；也和古希腊的希波克拉底相似，他将疾病归咎于四体液的不平衡。一些早期的中国医生认为疾病来自被激怒的鬼神，甚至现在，许多宗教依然相信神圣的原因和治愈方法。
- en: Instead of focusing on what you don’t know and can’t control, you can make luck
    by concentrating on the health issues you *can* influence. A study led by researchers
    at the Harvard School of Public Health found that well over a million people in
    the United States die prematurely every year because they’re overweight, smoke,
    or have high blood pressure. All those early deaths are preventable. Smoking alone
    accounts for a stunning one in five deaths. Losing weight or tossing away your
    cigarettes isn’t easy—but if you want to increase your luck of a full and healthy
    life, it’s one of the best approaches.

    with that. Shark attacks worry you? Well, of course. Steven Spielberg’s 1975 movie
    *Jaws* grossed some $260 million in the United States alone, and the Discovery
    Channel launched its annual Shark Week programming in 1988\. It’s now the longest-running
    cable television event in history. Discovery even tossed in a “mockumentary” one
    year, suggesting that a prehistoric shark called the megalodon had survived and
    gobbled up a pleasure boat and its crew. The channel has an online feature that
    lists twenty ways to avoid a shark attack. So if you want to get lucky in the
    water, you won’t swim with a bleeding cut, you’ll avoid shiny jewelry and brightly
    colored swimwear, and you’ll stay out of the water if you have an uneven tan,
    which may resemble the color variations found on fish.

  zh: 我们花费大量时间担心错误的事情——而且我们在这方面得到不少帮助。鲨鱼袭击让你担心吗？当然会了。斯蒂文·斯皮尔伯格1975年的电影*《大白鲨》*仅在美国就赚了约2.6亿美元，而发现频道在1988年推出了每年一度的鲨鱼周节目。现在，它已经成为有史以来播放时间最长的有线电视活动。发现频道甚至有一年还播出了一个“伪纪录片”，暗示一种叫做巨齿鲨的史前鲨鱼幸存下来，吞噬了一艘游艇和它的船员。该频道还有一个在线功能，列出了避免鲨鱼攻击的二十种方法。所以，如果你想在水中幸运地生还，就不要在身上有流血的伤口，不要佩戴闪亮的珠宝或穿鲜艳的泳衣，而且如果你有不均匀的晒伤色差，要远离水域，因为这可能会让你看起来像鱼的色彩变异。

    Take off the wet suit because you’re worried about sharks, and you may increase
    your risk of drowning. (A wet suit increases your buoyancy.) And if you really
    want to get lucky in life, you can frolic happily on the beach and not worry about
    either sharks or drowning—as long as you remember to stick to the speed limit

    West Africa was very real, but she hadn’t been to West Africa. She didn’t know

    health-luck in the next few months, since tens of thousands of people die every

    bad headache. She was stressed at work, and it would have been reasonable for
    any internist, particularly one as busy as Ron, to dash off a prescription for
    migraine medicine or suggest she de-stress with yoga. But she outlined her symptoms
    clearly, and some combination of experience and instinct told him there was a
    bigger problem. He sent her down the hall for an MRI. Within an hour, he had studied
    the scan, seen a brain aneurysm that was beginning to rupture, and had her in

    In a doctor’s office, the number would be even lower. More than 99 percent of

    there’s a good chance he’ll land on some suspicious finding. Uncertainty may lead
    to another test and then another one and perhaps an invasive procedure just to
    be sure—and whoops, there’s a complication. Now you really *are* sick, since secondary
    infections, misdiagnoses, and adverse reactions can kill you. I came across articles
    in several esteemed medical journals showing that some of the most popular tests—like
    standard screenings for heart disease and prostate cancer—often do more harm than
    good. As an article in *JAMA Internal Medicine* pointed out, “No test (not even

    pitcher Roger Clemens, who went on to win seven Cy Young Awards. (Clemens also

    twenty-eight had abnormal shoulder cartilage. But here’s the kicker. Every one

    we should do a biopsy anyway.” So I went to the hospital early one morning and
    put on a blue gown and paper slippers and sat freezing in the waiting room for
    an hour while my husband kept his arm protectively around me. Then I was led to
    the surgical suite and attacked by a scalpel. Of course it was fine. Given how

    how do you say no? The scan was fine—but turned up an incidental finding of a
    little thingie. And if there’s a little thingie, a doctor wants to follow it up.
    So there were more tests. Follow-ups for several months. I finally asked the radiologist
    if she had ever seen this kind of thingie turn to something more dangerous, and
    she said, “I haven’t in my experience, but that doesn’t mean it’s impossible.”
    Her experience included more than thirty years, so I decided enough was enough.
    But then my doctor (shockingly) suggested surgery. “Nothing seems wrong, but I
    can do it in a morning, and then you’ll know it’s gone,” he said. This time I

    you, ask questions but not in a negative way, and avoid rudeness that can have
    negative repercussions.

    up on the subject, I found several studies showing that the richest 1 percent
    of Americans live up to fifteen years longer than the poorest 1 percent. That’s
    a fairly stunning gap. This pattern isn’t new—having money has led to longer life
    for at least a couple of centuries.

  zh: 如果金钱不是问题，那么在健康方面创造好运就容易得多。在阅读相关资料时，我发现几项研究表明，美国最富有的1%人群比最贫困的1%人群多活十五年。这是一个相当惊人的差距。这个模式并不新鲜——有钱至少在过去几个世纪里一直带来了更长的寿命。
- en: The standard explanation is that if you have money, you can get the best doctors
    and the best care. Or more important, you can see a doctor at all. One series
    of reports found that low-income Americans don’t go to doctors because they can’t
    afford them—leading to worse outcomes.[*](71_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_4) But it’s
    more complicated than that. A study published in *JAMA* found that poorer Americans
    have a dramatically different life expectancy depending on where they live. It
    starts to seem that health care interventions make a difference, but far more
    important to longevity are individual behaviors. People who abuse drugs and alcohol
    die sooner. People who exercise, don’t smoke, and stay within a normal weight
    range live longer.

  zh: 标准的解释是，如果你有钱，你可以得到最好的医生和最好的治疗。或者更重要的是，你至少能看得了医生。一系列报告发现，低收入的美国人因为负担不起医生费用而不去看病——这导致了更糟的结果。[*](71_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_4)但事情比这更复杂。一项发表在*JAMA*上的研究发现，贫困的美国人根据居住地的不同，寿命差异巨大。看起来似乎医疗干预确实能带来差异，但对长寿更为重要的是个人行为。吸毒和酗酒的人寿命更短；而运动、不会吸烟并维持正常体重范围的人活得更久。
- en: Sure, you can blame your health problems on bad genes, but most studies now
    estimate that only about 25 percent of the variation in longevity is caused by
    genetic factors. Whatever your income level and family background, you can make
    luck in health by the choices you make. And the choices have to be rational—not
    based on the latest trends or pseudoscience. One man I know keeps to a careful
    gluten-free and meat-free diet (he doesn’t have an actual gluten allergy—he just
    thinks it’s better), but he also drinks about five glasses of wine a night. I’ve
    tried to tell him that there’s actual evidence showing excessive alcohol can cause
    harm and almost nothing that says meat and gluten will do you in. He thinks he’s
    making himself luckier—but I’m not so sure.

  zh: 当然，你可以把健康问题归咎于基因不好，但现在大多数研究估计，只有大约 25% 的寿命差异是由基因因素造成的。无论你的收入水平和家庭背景如何，你都可以通过自己的选择在健康上创造幸运。而这些选择必须是理性的——而不是基于最新的潮流或伪科学。我认识的一位男士严格遵守无麸质和无肉的饮食（他并没有真正的麸质过敏——他只是觉得这样更好），但他每天晚上喝大约五杯酒。我曾试图告诉他，有实际证据表明过量饮酒可能会造成伤害，而几乎没有证据表明肉类和麸质会对你造成危害。他认为自己在让自己更幸运——但我不太确定。

    we could use his example to make a plan for how to get to a hospital in an emergency.

  zh: 好吧，这听起来有道理。我们其他人可能负担不起自己的救护车，但我们可以以他的例子为借鉴，制定一个紧急时如何前往医院的计划。我位于康涅狄格州的家相当偏远，至少离任何技术高超的医院有一小时车程，这让我开始思考如果发生什么事情，我该怎么做。

    to them. I liked this story as a quirky example of how unconventional thinking
    can reduce risk and create luck. But then came a twist. On one particular day
    at his home in the Caribbean, the businessman decided to test out his system.
    He raced over to the ambulance, which was right there waiting for him, and he
    was ushered into the back. All was working as planned! The driver got behind the
    wheel and hit the ignition—but nothing happened. The car wouldn’t start. It turned
    out that the driver, bored from all the hours of sitting around, had been listening
    to a soccer game on the car radio all day. The battery was dead.

    Broadway to see the new musical *Groundhog Day.*[*](73_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_6)
    The audience was packed with critics and reporters (the show was about to officially
    open), so it was an important night. The show, based on the popular movie, was
    terrific, and by intermission, it was clear that lead actor Andy Karl was the
    breakout star of the season. He was handsome and funny and perfect in the role.
    The audience loved him. I loved him.

  zh: 在一个星期五的晚上，我在思考运气和健康的同时，去了百老汇看新剧《土拨鼠日》[*](73_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_6)。观众中坐满了评论家和记者（因为演出即将正式首演），这对演出来说是一个重要的夜晚。改编自热门电影的这部剧非常精彩，中场休息时，大家已经看出男主角安迪·卡尔是本季的最大亮点。他英俊、幽默，完美诠释了角色。观众喜爱他，我也爱他。
- en: The fast-paced show required lots of physical exertion from Karl, but he made
    it seem effortless. Then toward the end of the show, he was dashing across the
    stage, did a leap, and landed wrong. He fell, and his knee gave out. He crawled
    off the stage. The show stopped, and the curtain came down. The stage manager
    asked if there was a doctor in the house.

- en: It turned out that Karl had badly injured his knee. But after twenty minutes
    or so, he decided to finish. The curtain came up again with the star center stage,
    and barely able to walk, Karl leaned on scenery and a makeshift cane. His face
    was contorted with pain, but he kept singing and charming. By coincidence, the
    lyrics of one of the songs included the lines “I’m here, and I’m fine,” and the
    audience roared approval.

- en: At the end, the audience jumped up cheering for him, and Karl looked out to
    the standing ovation, tears streaming down his face. He wasn’t just the new star
    of Broadway—he was an inspiration. We all face challenges, and sometimes all you
    can do is to keep going and trying to make the best of whatever situation you

- en: Leaving the theater, I thought of an Arabic-speaking friend of mine, who had
    told me that there wasn’t a word in his language for “accident.” “The word we
    would use is *hadit*, which means more ‘incident’ or ‘event,’” he said. *Hadit*
    was a good way to think about that night. Getting injured was just one of those
    events that happens and can’t be anticipated. Karl had done everything right to
    prepare—he was in great shape (with the muscles to prove it) and had probably
    done that leap a hundred times in rehearsal.

  zh: 离开剧院时，我想到了一个说阿拉伯语的朋友，他曾告诉我，在他的语言中没有“事故”这个词。他说：“我们用的词是*hadit*，意思更接近‘事件’或‘事故’。”*Hadit*
    是个很好的方式来理解那一晚。受伤不过是那些发生且无法预料的事件之一。卡尔为准备做好了一切——他的身体状态非常好（肌肉也能证明这一点），他可能在排练中做过那一跃上百次。
- en: When an incident occurs—whether a busted knee or an unexpected diagnosis—we
    still have a role in how our luck unfolds. We can give up and bemoan the fates
    and the bad timing. Or we can decide to face whatever happens with a firm determination
    to make our own luck and a decision that the show (and life) must go on.
