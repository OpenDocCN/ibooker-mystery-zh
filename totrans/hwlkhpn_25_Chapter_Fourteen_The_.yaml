    disease. But until science has a firmer grasp of them, most of us are frightened
    by the seeming randomness of how disease strikes. A healthy nonsmoker getting
    lung cancer? How can you control the bad luck that seems uncontrollable? As we
    look for causes of the unknown, we’re not that far removed from the ancient Roman
    poet Lucretius, who thought people got sickened by “seeds” in the air, and ancient
    Greeks like Hippocrates, who blamed an imbalance of the four humors. Some early
    Chinese physicians thought illness came from spirits who had been angered, and
    even now many religions believe in divine causes and cures.

    migraine medicine or suggest she de-stress with yoga. But she outlined her symptoms
    clearly, and some combination of experience and instinct told him there was a
    bigger problem. He sent her down the hall for an MRI. Within an hour, he had studied

    their chance of a lucky result. But Dr. Jones thinks you can just ask any physician
    “where they stand on the range of opinions in the field and whether they’re conservative
    or aggressive. When it comes to cancer, I cut wide and take large margins. There
    are other people in my field of sarcoma surgery who try to cut as close as they

    there’s a good chance he’ll land on some suspicious finding. Uncertainty may lead
    to another test and then another one and perhaps an invasive procedure just to
    be sure—and whoops, there’s a complication. Now you really *are* sick, since secondary
    infections, misdiagnoses, and adverse reactions can kill you. I came across articles

    chance you or someone you know has been through the experience. It happened to
    me twice. Once a doctor convinced me to get a mammogram even though I was not
    yet forty. “Why wait?” he asked. (I later discovered I would have been luckier
    to wait.) The test found a tiny something that the doctor was sure was benign—“but
    we should do a biopsy anyway.” So I went to the hospital early one morning and
    put on a blue gown and paper slippers and sat freezing in the waiting room for
    an hour while my husband kept his arm protectively around me. Then I was led to
    the surgical suite and attacked by a scalpel. Of course it was fine. Given how
    young I was, the odds of a false positive on that mammogram far outweighed the
    likelihood of a real finding. So there was nothing wrong at all—except the surgeon

    little thingie. And if there’s a little thingie, a doctor wants to follow it up.
    So there were more tests. Follow-ups for several months. I finally asked the radiologist
    if she had ever seen this kind of thingie turn to something more dangerous, and
    she said, “I haven’t in my experience, but that doesn’t mean it’s impossible.”
    Her experience included more than thirty years, so I decided enough was enough.

    take. If you don’t have a primary care physician now, finding one is an easy way
    to increase your luck. Sure, most doctors see a lot of patients, and some studies
    have questioned whether an annual physical really improves health. But that regular
    visit does give you a connection to a doctor who can coordinate your care and
    make the call to the emergency room if necessary to get you admitted. In the lucky-in-health
    sweepstakes, that counts for a lot.

- en: Barnaby and I gave a call to Dr. Neha Vapiwala, advisory dean at the Perelman
    School of Medicine and director of the residency program there, to talk about
    how to make luck inside a hospital. Most of the better hospitals in the country
    are now putting safety practices in place—and trying to change the dismal fact
    that medical mistakes are now the third leading cause of death in the country.
    That’s pretty stunning. Only cancer and heart disease kill more people than medical
    mistakes. Dr. Vapiwala suggested that you increase the likelihood of a lucky outcome
    if you have someone who can hang around the hospital with you, be your advocate,
    and keep an eye on things.

    had been hospitalized for early complications from a pregnancy. One night a nurse
    woke her up at midnight saying that it was time to take her pills. “My friend
    said, ‘Are you sure? I’ve been here a week and I never get medicine in the middle
    of the night.’ The nurse insisted, but my friend wouldn’t take it.” Britney shook
    her head. “It was midnight and she’d been woken up and was drowsy but she still
    managed to question it! How many people could do that?” It was good that she did—because
    sure enough, the nurse had brought the medicine to the wrong patient.

    she’d taken drugs that weren’t even for her,” Britney said.

    about the ins and outs of hospitals had made her somewhat panicked about her own
    delivery. She had decided to have a doula with her, just so there could be one
    more person asking questions and making sure no mistakes were made.

    own luck by staying involved with your care. “You should have the comfort level
    to talk to the doctors and nurses treating you,” she said. “Some people are afraid
    to antagonize the team—just like they don’t want to upset the waiter who is bringing
    their food.” But the outcomes here are more significant than an overdone burger
    or a soggy salad. Dr. Vapiwala suggested that you need to be able to find a tone
    of questioning without negativity, and the team treating you needs to be able
    to hear it.

    doctors and nurses dealt with the fragile, vulnerable babies in an intensive care
    unit. Using simulated scenarios, the researchers found that when a parent said
    something rude, the doctors and nurses made more errors and their skills deteriorated.
    They weren’t being vindictive—they knew they were being evaluated—but their performance
    slipped anyway. The authors of the study concluded that the rude comments distracted
    the doctors and nurses and drew their cognitive resources from the work they needed
    to do.

    you need to take charge of your own care, make sure someone is advocating for
    you, ask questions but not in a negative way, and avoid rudeness that can have
    negative repercussions.

    up on the subject, I found several studies showing that the richest 1 percent
    of Americans live up to fifteen years longer than the poorest 1 percent. That’s
    a fairly stunning gap. This pattern isn’t new—having money has led to longer life
    for at least a couple of centuries.
  prefs: []

- en: The standard explanation is that if you have money, you can get the best doctors
    and the best care. Or more important, you can see a doctor at all. One series
    of reports found that low-income Americans don’t go to doctors because they can’t
    afford them—leading to worse outcomes.[*](71_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_4) But it’s
    more complicated than that. A study published in *JAMA* found that poorer Americans
    have a dramatically different life expectancy depending on where they live. It
    starts to seem that health care interventions make a difference, but far more
    important to longevity are individual behaviors. People who abuse drugs and alcohol
    die sooner. People who exercise, don’t smoke, and stay within a normal weight
    range live longer.

- en: Sure, you can blame your health problems on bad genes, but most studies now
    estimate that only about 25 percent of the variation in longevity is caused by
    genetic factors. Whatever your income level and family background, you can make
    luck in health by the choices you make. And the choices have to be rational—not
    based on the latest trends or pseudoscience. One man I know keeps to a careful
    gluten-free and meat-free diet (he doesn’t have an actual gluten allergy—he just
    thinks it’s better), but he also drinks about five glasses of wine a night. I’ve
    tried to tell him that there’s actual evidence showing excessive alcohol can cause
    harm and almost nothing that says meat and gluten will do you in. He thinks he’s
    making himself luckier—but I’m not so sure.

    has an enormously wealthy friend who lives in one of the largest townhouses in

    we could use his example to make a plan for how to get to a hospital in an emergency.
    My home in Connecticut is in a fairly remote area, at least an hour from any highly
    skilled hospital, so it inspired me to think about what I would do if something
    happened.

    to them. I liked this story as a quirky example of how unconventional thinking
    can reduce risk and create luck. But then came a twist. On one particular day
    at his home in the Caribbean, the businessman decided to test out his system.
    He raced over to the ambulance, which was right there waiting for him, and he
    was ushered into the back. All was working as planned! The driver got behind the
    wheel and hit the ignition—but nothing happened. The car wouldn’t start. It turned
    out that the driver, bored from all the hours of sitting around, had been listening
    to a soccer game on the car radio all day. The battery was dead.

    Broadway to see the new musical *Groundhog Day.*[*](73_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_6)
    The audience was packed with critics and reporters (the show was about to officially
    open), so it was an important night. The show, based on the popular movie, was
    terrific, and by intermission, it was clear that lead actor Andy Karl was the
    breakout star of the season. He was handsome and funny and perfect in the role.
    The audience loved him. I loved him.

    it seem effortless. Then toward the end of the show, he was dashing across the
    stage, did a leap, and landed wrong. He fell, and his knee gave out. He crawled
    off the stage. The show stopped, and the curtain came down. The stage manager
    asked if there was a doctor in the house.

    or so, he decided to finish. The curtain came up again with the star center stage,
    and barely able to walk, Karl leaned on scenery and a makeshift cane. His face
    was contorted with pain, but he kept singing and charming. By coincidence, the
    lyrics of one of the songs included the lines “I’m here, and I’m fine,” and the
    audience roared approval.

    the standing ovation, tears streaming down his face. He wasn’t just the new star

    would use is *hadit*, which means more ‘incident’ or ‘event,’” he said. *Hadit*
    was a good way to think about that night. Getting injured was just one of those
    events that happens and can’t be anticipated. Karl had done everything right to
    prepare—he was in great shape (with the muscles to prove it) and had probably
    done that leap a hundred times in rehearsal.
