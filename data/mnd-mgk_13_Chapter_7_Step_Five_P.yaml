- en: The most treacherous place to sail on earth is the Intertropical Convergence
    Zone, known by sailors as “the doldrums.” Near the thermal equator, the northeast
    and southeast trade winds converge, and as the northeast winds die off, they are
    replaced by long periods of calm followed by severe buffeting squalls and light,
    baffling winds. It is considered a navigator’s nightmare because it is almost
    impossible to tell which way the current is heading, at what speed, and from what
    direction the wind blew in the last squall.

    he put on a brave face for the media and the Polynesians placing their deepest
    hopes on his success, he doubted his ability to navigate under nearly 100 percent

    was a break in the clouds and the light of the moon shone through, just where
    I expected it to be. I can’t explain it, but that was one of the most precious

- en: Manifesting is a practice of engagement and, more importantly, understanding
    the process of placing one’s intention into the subconscious, which takes many
    rounds of repetition. As with any practice, it is wise to start with a small,
    manageable goal that is not too far out of reach. If we try to jump ahead a million
    steps and expect spectacular results instantly, we will inevitably feel let down
    and become discouraged with the entire process. Even worse, we will probably become
    excessively self-critical and take our disappointment out on ourselves. Achieving
    a small goal helps us to build confidence in ourselves and in the process itself,
    and the positive emotions we feel upon achieving the goal buoy us up to pursue
    the next one. This is the nature of small changes or baby steps. They strengthen
    us without overwhelming us.

  zh: 实现是一个参与的过程，更重要的是，理解将一个人的意图置入潜意识的过程，这需要多次重复。像任何实践一样，明智的做法是从一个小而可管理的目标开始，这个目标并不太遥不可及。如果我们试图跳过一百万步，期待立刻获得惊人的结果，最终不可避免地会感到失望，并对整个过程感到沮丧。更糟的是，我们可能会过于自我批评，把失望转嫁到自己身上。实现一个小目标帮助我们在自己和过程本身中建立信心，而在实现目标时感受到的积极情绪则激励我们追求下一个目标。这就是小改变或婴儿步伐的本质。它们让我们变得更强大，而不会让我们感到不堪重负。
- en: Manifesting is not a one-off practice; it is not a magic wand, and it does not
    allow us to leap over the laws of physics or the natural stages of human development.
    There is no ceiling to what we can pursue, but even our wildest dreams can only
    be realized one step at a time. Although it may sometimes work quickly, manifesting
    does not just magically happen overnight. It does not go from zero to one hundred
    in a microsecond. It must also be recognized that manifesting is not a passive
    endeavor. It is an active process of taking baby steps that lead to the ultimate
    goal. One must also be committed to the work involved in manifesting, whether
    that means pursuing an academic achievement or trying to bench-press four hundred
    pounds. That said, we can manifest extraordinary things, but first they must be
    embedded in the subconscious. Over time, as opportunities present themselves and
    we respond, each of these small events ultimately contribute to the manifestation
    of that intention.

- en: The nervous system is constantly responding to those around us and our environment,
    scanning for threats and opportunities. Through the process described by Stephen
    Porges as *neuroception*, a subconscious system for detecting threats and safety,
    we classify every encounter with another person as safe or dangerous, subconsciously
    deciding to approach or move away. When we are in the rest-and-digest mode, our
    bodies express what is known as the *social engagement system*, accompanied by
    a series of physiological changes. Our heart rate slows, saliva and digestion
    are activated, facial muscles are stimulated to express positive mental states,
    and there is an increase in vocal expressiveness and a willingness to make sustained
    eye contact with others. These changes affect how we react to stimuli, what kinds
    of expressions appear on our face, and, most importantly for manifesting, how
    others respond to us. When we look at the world in a different way, we move through
    it in a different way, and in turn the world sees us in a different way. One extraordinary
    example is that the middle-range muscles in our ears come online, and these are
    the muscles that are designed to hear nuances in the human voice. As researchers
    into the polyvagal theory have discovered, the human voice sounds special to our
    ears only when we feel safe. When we are in fight, flight, or freeze, our ears
    focus only on high and low frequencies because these tend to indicate the approach
    of predators. In other words, only when we feel safe and taken care of can we
    truly hear another human being.

- en: In my case, it has been a lifelong practice to learn to listen. I mean really
    listen, not just sit there watching the other person talk while I prepare my own
    calculated response. It has often been said about brain surgeons that we are “often
    wrong, never in doubt.” I used to bring this arrogant attitude to all my interactions,
    and the truth is that I was depriving myself of actual connection with others.
    The more I practiced just being OK with myself, the more I found I was able to
    attune to others and really take in what they were saying. In a sense, manifesting
    is the skill of connecting to those around us, our environment and our context,
    and kindness and genuine compassion are our direct physiological pathways to that
    connection. When we express the prosocial physiology of the rest-and-digest response,
    others instinctively want to help us achieve our goals because they sense our
    actions are serving the greater good and making a contribution to the whole. In
    fact, the pleasure and reward systems of our brains light up not only when we
    are being generous or experiencing the generosity of others but also as a response

- en: When we are in the Green Zone, as discussed in Chapter 2, other people like
    us and enjoy being around us. Part of the power of the mammalian caregiving system
    is that when we ourselves are in distress, or we encounter distress in others,
    we can, if we feel safe enough, choose to self-soothe and practice compassion
    instead of fighting or withdrawing. Consequently, because we naturally mirror
    the autonomic state of people around us, our Green Zone state can trigger the
    Green Zone state in others because they then feel safe, relaxed, and at ease in
    our presence. Our self-compassion can be contagious, as with the electromagnetic
    field of the heart in a state of coherence. Feeling safe is necessary to form
    strong social relationships. Safety allows for physical proximity and the intimacy-building
    that arises from friendly and caring touch. Positive physical contact promotes
    the release of oxytocin, which in turn allows for social bonding to take place.
    We need to feel safe enough to be physically close to others in order to become

- en: Another way to approach blocks to manifesting involves making use of our brain’s
    natural ability to scan for clues in our environment. In the previous chapter,
    we learned about the filing clerk and the bloodhound in our subconscious. Once
    the filing clerk has classified our intention as salient and given its scent to
    the bloodhound, the hound will begin to hunt for any trace of opportunity to fulfill
    our intention. This is the origin of the phenomenon of *synchronicity*, the sudden,
    often surprising appearance of meaningful coincidences in our lives that we did
    not notice before. If we are stuck in our manifesting process, we can practice
    paying careful attention to the subtle hints and unexpected connections we may
    have dismissed as accidental or irrelevant. Often these strange confluences can
    be subtle signposts that guide us enigmatically on our path. Only when we look
    back and reflect on the string of connections do we realize their internal logic.

  zh: 另一种接近阻碍显化的方法涉及利用我们大脑在环境中寻找线索的自然能力。在前一章中，我们了解了我们潜意识中的文件管理员和血猎。一旦文件管理员将我们的意图分类为显著，并给予血猎其气味，猎犬将开始寻找任何能够实现我们意图的机会迹象。这就是*同步现象*的起源，即在我们生活中突然出现有意义的巧合，而我们以前没有注意到。如果我们在显化过程中遇到困难，我们可以练习注意那些微妙的暗示和意想不到的联系，这些联系可能被我们误以为是偶然或无关紧要的。通常，这些奇怪的汇合点可以作为微妙的路标，神秘地指引我们的道路。只有当我们回顾并反思连接的一系列事件时，我们才意识到它们的内在逻辑。
- en: Consider anything that has happened to you recently that struck you as “weird.”
    Maybe three different people with no relationship to one another have recommended
    the same book to you, or you have had a recurring dream about a particular landscape
    that feels full of meaning, or you casually mentioned your intention to someone
    at a dinner party or work event and they happened to know someone whose help would
    have a great impact on your project. Maybe a phrase keeps popping into your head
    and you can’t remember the source, or you feel drawn for no rational reason to
    a particular neighborhood, or you have a sudden inspiration to contact an old
    friend you haven’t seen in years. With its narrow focus on short-term goals, our
    conscious mind is not always the most reliable judge of what is truly important
    for us to know and recognize, and so we must make space for the quieter, more
    intuitive messages of our subconscious that often speak to us through unexpected
    correlations between people, environment, events, and things.

    the Taliban might have infiltrated the group, the refugees were directed onto
    two small islands filled with land mines, claimed by neither Tajikistan nor Afghanistan,
    on the Amu Darya River. As a result, this became an emergency crisis and Amandine
    was asked to go with three others to give aid and document the situation. She
    was terrified both by the Tajik-manned Russian tanks on one side, and the Kalashnikovs
    of the Taliban on the other side. Nonetheless, she accepted the assignment and
    fell in love with the Afghan people she met, touched by their generous hospitality.

- en: Sometimes, to realize our intention, we must commit to putting in some hard
    work. The process is the same as when building any positive habit. As an example,
    over the last few years I’ve gained weight, which, in conjunction with an old
    skiing accident where I injured my left knee, further limited my desire and motivation
    to exercise. I live in a hilly neighborhood; when I step out of my house, I am
    faced immediately with a steep incline. I had not exercised for a while, but I
    decided to lose weight. By this time I had remarried; I recruited my new wife
    to help me, and early one morning we went for a walk up the hills. Right away,
    I was huffing and puffing, and saying, “God, this is not going to work. I can’t
    do this. This is horrible, my knee is killing me.”

  zh: 有时候，为了实现我们的意图，我们必须承诺投入一些艰苦的工作。这个过程与建立任何积极习惯是一样的。举个例子，过去几年我增了体重，这与我之前摔伤左膝盖的旧滑雪事故一起，进一步限制了我锻炼的欲望和动机。我住在一个丘陵的社区；当我走出家门时，立即面临陡峭的坡道。我已经有一段时间没锻炼了，但我决定要减肥。那时我已经再婚；我让我的新妻子帮我，清晨我们一起去爬坡。刚开始，我就气喘吁吁地说：“天哪，这不行。我做不到。这太糟糕了，我的膝盖疼得厉害。”
- en: My body, which wasn’t used to pumping blood at that level, rebelled at the discomfort,
    and that produced mental signals in the form of “I can’t do this, I can’t take
    this, it’s not going to work.” But actually, all that was happening was resistance
    because I was out of shape. I quickly gave up and went back into the house to
    lick my wounds. Then one day I woke up at five thirty a.m. and said, “Fuck it,
    I’m just going to do it.” I envisioned myself not only doing it but being in good
    physical shape. I did the entire walk without stopping, although I was definitely
    huffing and puffing and my knee was hurting. Now I have been doing it for a few
    weeks. And the funny thing is, every morning I wake up and say, “I hate this.
    I do not want to do this; it isn’t going to work.” And then I just put my clothes
    on and go do it. I override my pain and my fear of discomfort because I know that
    in the long run, the exercise is healthy for me, perhaps lifesaving. I teach my
    body that what it is resistant to doing in the short term will benefit it in the
    long term. What I realize is that each time I complete my walk, I feel inspired
    and elevated because I am reminded, first, that anything is possible with the
    right intention, and second, that my walks up the hill will ultimately benefit
    me and I can enjoy the sense of well-being that they bring.

  zh: 我的身体不习惯在那种强度下泵血，抗拒这种不适，这产生了“我做不到，我受不了，这行不通”的心理信号。但实际上，所有发生的只是因为我状态不好而产生的抵抗。我很快就放弃了，回到屋里舔舐伤口。然后有一天，我早上五点半醒来，心想：“去他的，我就要去做。”我想象自己不仅在做这件事，还能保持良好的身体状态。我没有停下来完成整段步行，虽然我肯定气喘吁吁，膝盖也在疼。现在我已经坚持了几个星期。有趣的是，每天早上我醒来时都说：“我讨厌这个。我不想这样做；这行不通。”然后我就穿上衣服去做。我压过了我的疼痛和对不适的恐惧，因为我知道从长远来看，锻炼对我有好处，甚至可能是救命的。我教我的身体，短期内抵抗的事情从长远来看会带来好处。我意识到每次完成步行时，我都感到振奋和提升，因为我被提醒，首先，任何事情在正确的意图下都是可能的；其次，我的上坡步行最终会让我受益，我可以享受由此带来的健康感。

    life. In those moments, while everyone around me was panicking, I returned to
    my fundamental practices: I calmed my mind, relaxed my body, and opened my heart.
    I visualized exactly the procedure that I needed to do in order to save my patient’s
    life, and I let myself and my hands be guided by a possibility that is beyond
    reason, and beyond skill. I let go of my conscious mind’s frantic desire to control
    the situation and make it reasonable and predictable, and I surrendered to the
    amazing skill of my subconscious, by which life itself could flow through me.'
