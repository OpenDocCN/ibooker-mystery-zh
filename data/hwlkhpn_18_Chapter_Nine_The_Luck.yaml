- en: As we took a walk together one day through Central Park, Barnaby brought up
    the subject of lucky breaks—and I began thinking about a lovely young woman who
    works in the grocery store near my house in rural Connecticut. Always eager to
    help, she has a gentle style, a warm smile, and an air of competence that her
    IGA apron can’t hide. Plus, she’s quite beautiful, with the slightly exotic looks
    of the first assistant I hired when I was a TV producer.

  zh: 有一天，我们一起在中央公园散步时，巴纳比提到了幸运的机遇——我开始想到一位在我住的康涅狄格州乡村附近的杂货店工作的年轻姑娘。她总是热心帮助别人，举止温和，笑容温暖，身上散发出一种自信的气质，尽管她身穿的IGA围裙遮掩不了这一点。而且，她非常美丽，拥有与我在做电视制作人时雇佣的第一位助理相似的稍显异国风情的面容。

  zh: 真的吗？一个没有让你变得……幸运的幸运机遇？
- en: In the best of all worlds, a lucky break is the monumental event that changes
    everything. Your boss quits and hands you his job, your start-up sells for a billion
    dollars, or your YouTube video goes viral and makes you famous. Actress Shirley
    MacLaine was just out of high school and an understudy for the Broadway production
    of *The Pajama Game* when the starring actress broke her ankle—and MacLaine landed
    center stage. A very literal lucky break! (Though only for one of them.)

  zh: 在最理想的世界里，幸运的机遇是改变一切的重大事件。你的老板辞职，把工作交给了你，你的初创公司卖了十亿美元，或者你的视频在YouTube上爆红，让你一夜成名。女演员雪莉·麦克雷恩刚高中毕业，是百老汇剧目《睡衣游戏》的替补演员，当时主演摔断了脚踝——麦克雷恩因此登上了舞台中央。真的是一个字面意义上的幸运“断裂”！（尽管仅对其中一个人而言是如此。）
- en: Those earth-shattering events do happen, but Barnaby was right. Like MacLaine’s,
    your lucky break could lead to a career marked by six Academy Award nominations—or
    it could lead to absolutely nothing. Because if you’re not prepared, you’re going
    to blow the chance you’ve been given.

  zh: 这些震撼人心的事件确实会发生，但巴纳比是对的。像麦克雷恩的经历一样，你的幸运机遇可能会带来六次奥斯卡提名的事业——也可能什么都没有。因为如果你没有准备好，你将错失已经给你的一次机会。
- en: The real secret is knowing what to do *after* the big opportunity comes—because
    a lucky break is not the same as a lucky outcome. In our slot machine of chance,
    talent, and hard work, a lucky break is the big cherry of chance. But you still
    need those other two cherries lined up. We’ve all heard the stories of athletes
    with multimillion-dollar contracts who get arrested and thrown out of their sport,
    or lottery winners who end up penniless and angry. A lucky break turns out to
    be like any other opportunity. You can recognize that it’s in front of you and
    make it part of a lucky life. Or you can mishandle it so it leads to nothing—or
    disaster.

  zh: 真正的秘密在于知道**大机会**到来之后该怎么做——因为幸运的机遇不等同于幸运的结果。在我们的机会、才华和努力的老虎机中，幸运的机遇就像是大奖中的大樱桃。但你仍然需要那另外两个樱桃排成一线。我们都听过这样的故事：那些拥有百万合同的运动员，最后被捕并被驱逐出体育界，或者中彩票的幸运儿最终破产且愤怒。幸运的机遇原来和其他机会一样。你可以认识到它就在眼前，并将其变成幸运人生的一部分。或者你可能把它处理得一无所获，甚至灾难重重。
- en: You’ll be able to make the most of a lucky break only if you’ve laid the proper
    foundation for it. MacLaine didn’t just waltz (or tap-dance) onto the Broadway
    stage—she had been preparing to be a dancer since she was three years old. Acting
    was also in the family genes. (Her brother is actor Warren Beatty.) When she had
    the chance to be onstage, she was fully prepared. Similarly, if you buy a lottery
    ticket with an actual idea of what you’ll do with any winnings, you’ll be in a
    better position to handle the windfall than if you’ve just fantasized that big
    bucks will change your life. The chances of winning are so small that preparing
    ahead probably isn’t worth it in this case. But you get the point.

  zh: 只有在你为幸运的机会打下了合适的基础后，你才能充分利用它。麦克莱恩可不是随便走上百老汇舞台的——她从三岁开始就为做舞蹈演员做准备。演戏也属于她家族的基因。（她的哥哥是演员沃伦·比蒂。）当她有机会登台时，她已经做好了充分的准备。同样地，如果你买彩票时已经想好了中奖后的计划，你将比那些只是幻想着中奖能改变生活的人，更能应对这笔意外的财富。虽然中奖的机会非常小，但提前准备可能在这种情况下并不值得。然而，你明白我的意思。
- en: Many times a lucky break isn’t a huge rupture in the earth but just the tiniest
    little crack. A small advantage can grow into something big and bigger. If you’re
    waiting for the big break, you’ll miss the truth that most luck builds and builds
    on itself. The challenge is to realize how a tiny lucky break can become an enormous
    one.

- en: So let’s start with the story that penicillin was discovered by sheer chance
    when Alexander Fleming found mold growing in one of his petri dishes. As the story
    goes, he went away for a month-long family vacation in September 1928 and left
    several petri dishes with *Staphylococcus* bacteria on the windowsill of his lab.
    When he got back, one of the dishes was contaminated with mold. And lo and behold,
    the bacteria surrounding the mold had been destroyed.

- en: He didn’t shout, “Eureka!” or go running naked through the streets (as Archimedes
    reportedly once did),[*](57_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_4) but he did realize that
    the mold might have inhibited the bacterial growth. And there you have it—one

- en: “When I woke up just after dawn on September 28, 1928, I certainly didn’t plan

- en: The revolution wasn’t quite as casual as all that. During World War I, Fleming
    had been in the Royal Army Medical Corps doing research into wound infections
    and antiseptics. After the war, he returned to his lab at St. Mary’s Hospital
    at the University of London, and by 1921, he had made his first big discovery,

- en: That research reportedly began when Fleming had a cold and dropped some mucus
    into one of his bacteria cultures. Are you starting to see a pattern here? The

- en: At the time of his family vacation, Fleming had been working on questions about
    bacteria and the human immune system for more than a decade. As is often the case
    in science, he had many small breakthroughs and lots of incremental steps. Many
    of the things he tried didn’t lead anywhere. When one does pay off, it’s not random

    that he had attended fifty years earlier. As he looked out at the sixty-one children

    headlines around the country. In interviews, Lang pointed out that it wasn’t just
    the money that made the difference but the ability of the children to dream. Somebody

    tuition—wouldn’t do anything if the kids didn’t have the grit or interest or vision
    to stay in school. So he put people in place who could tutor and help support
    the kids and their struggling parents.

    look back and recognize the people along the way who helped and supported them—parents

- en: Basting heard the news about her genius award—the luckiest break she could imagine—one
    day when she was driving in her car and the phone rang. She didn’t recognize the
    number but picked up anyway. Conrad, who has a very cheerful voice, introduced
    herself and asked Basting if she was in a place to have a private conversation.
    Hearing that she was in the car, Conrad suggested she pull over.

  zh: 巴斯廷在一天开车时听到了有关她获得天才奖的消息——这对她来说是最幸运的机会——当时电话响了。她没有认出号码，但还是接了。康拉德有着非常愉快的声音，她自我介绍并问巴斯廷是否在一个可以私下交谈的地方。听说她在车里，康拉德建议她停车。

    so we’d have to chat for a mile until the next exit,” Basting said with a laugh.

- en: Basting was the first person from the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee ever
    to win a genius award, and only a handful of the winners (close to 1,000 since
    the awards began in 1981) have ever hailed from that state at all. The foundation
    created a map showing where all the MacArthur Fellows were born and where they
    lived when they won the award—and (aside from the international winners),[*](58_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_5)
    New York and California come out on top in both counts. When you adjust for population,
    the prominence of winners *born* in those states isn’t surprising, but much more
    dramatic is where people *ended up*. Well over half were living in New York, California,
    and Massachusetts when they got the lucky fellowship.

  zh: 巴斯廷是威斯康星大学密尔沃基分校首位获得天才奖的人，且自1981年颁奖以来，只有少数几位得奖者（接近1000人）来自该州。基金会制作了一张地图，展示所有麦克阿瑟奖学者的出生地和获奖时居住地——（除了国际奖得主），[*](58_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_5)纽约和加利福尼亚在这两个统计上均名列前茅。当你调整人口数据后，那些州出生的获奖者的突出地位并不令人惊讶，但更为戏剧性的是人们“最终”在哪里定居。超过一半的获奖者在获得这份幸运的奖学金时，住在纽约、加利福尼亚和马萨诸塞州。
- en: If you want to increase your luck in any creative field, from arts to science
    to humanities to teaching, you may need to buy a plane ticket. “There’s an element
    of putting yourself in places where luck might find you,” Conrad said. “The complementarities
    for people in the same place make more opportunities for luck to happen. Big cities
    draw more creative and original types, and there are also clusters around top
    educational institutions.”

  zh: 如果你想在任何创造性领域增加好运，无论是艺术、科学、人文学科还是教学，你可能需要买张机票。“有一个因素是把自己置于那些可能会遇到好运的地方，”康拉德说。“在同一个地方的人们之间的互补性，能创造更多的好运机会。大城市吸引更多的创造性和独特类型的人，而顶级教育机构周围也有集聚效应。”
- en: Lucky breaks (and $625,000) don’t just fall from the sky, and Conrad thinks
    you pave the way for your own good fortune. It starts with “basic competency,
    skills, and hard work—and being passionate about possibilities,” she said. Then
    comes a willingness to pursue your passions without an obvious end in sight. “The
    payoff may be far off and outside the norm. You have to take risks and be willing
    to fail—which is a form of resilience.”

  zh: 幸运的机遇（以及625,000美元）不是从天而降的，康拉德认为你需要为自己的好运铺路。她说，这从“基本能力、技能和努力工作开始——并且要对可能性感到热情。”接着就是愿意追求自己的激情，即便没有明显的终点。“回报可能遥不可及，甚至超出常规。你必须冒险并愿意失败——这是一种韧性的表现。”
- en: Anne Basting is a perfect example of all that. She got lucky by caring only
    about the deep impact her work would have. “I don’t follow the same benchmarks
    for success that other people do,” she admitted. “My satisfaction for the work
    is what keeps me persevering. I count the importance of my work by how it makes
    me feel. And I know that when others see it, they feel the power of it, too.”
    A willingness to find your own niche and dance on the creative edges, no matter
    what the result, brings its own good luck. You become the only judge of what matters,
    and with or without a fellowship, the work feels like a lucky break.

- en: Speaking with Cecilia Conrad and Anne Basting, I realized that there’s another
    sort of follow-through at play here—a lucky break can have a huge multiplier effect.
    When you change one person’s life, you can have a domino effect on others. Anne
    Basting works with people with dementia (“please don’t call them patients,” she
    said), and her lucky break with the genius award means she can spread the wealth
    and the opportunities to more of the elderly who need it.

  zh: 与塞西莉亚·康拉德和安妮·巴斯廷交谈时，我意识到这里还有另一种形式的跟进——一次幸运的突破能产生巨大的倍增效应。当你改变一个人的生活时，你可以对其他人产生连锁反应。安妮·巴斯廷与患有痴呆症的人合作（“请不要称他们为病人，”她说），她凭借天才奖的幸运突破，意味着她可以将这些财富和机会传播给更多需要它的老年人。
- en: The MacArthur Foundation is now trying to support that domino effect by getting
    into the lucky-break business in the biggest way possible—offering a hundred-million-dollar
    grant to a single project. A hundred million dollars. That’s big bucks no matter
    how you look at it. Conrad told me that the foundation’s 100&Change competition
    gave a payout ten or a hundred times bigger than the biggest grants that foundations
    typically give. And it came with almost no guidelines. The idea wasn’t just to
    figure out the solution to a problem—but to decide what problem needed to be solved.

    aback when more than 1,900 proposals came in. But there was a lesson for the rest
    of us in that, too. A majority of the proposals were dropped for not meeting basic
    requirements, and only 800 were passed on to the judges. If you want a lucky break
