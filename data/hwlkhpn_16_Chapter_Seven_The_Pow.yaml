    out the window as we passed Edison, New Jersey. The connection to the great inventor
    Thomas Edison—the guy who said that genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent
    perspiration—got Barnaby thinking.

  zh: 一周后，巴纳比在从普林斯顿返回的火车上，恰好看到窗外经过新泽西的爱迪生小镇。与伟大发明家托马斯·爱迪生的联系——这位曾说过天才是1%的灵感加99%的汗水的人——让巴纳比开始思考。
- en: “If you want to make luck, you have to be persistent,” Barnaby said. “Many of
    life’s failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success
    when they gave up.”

- en: Edison invented the lightbulb, the phonograph, the movie camera, and a thousand
    other things—or make that 1,093, the number of US patents he holds. But he didn’t
    hit on any of them by random chance. He once explained that he never failed, but
    he had found at least 10,000 things that didn’t work.

  zh: 爱迪生发明了电灯泡、留声机、电影摄影机以及其他成千上万的东西——或者说是1,093项，美国专利的数量。他并不是偶然发现这些发明的。他曾解释说，他从未失败过，只是找到了至少10,000种行不通的方法。
- en: Barnaby has a soft spot for Edison because he shares the great inventor’s intensity.
    He is convinced that if he wants something fervently enough, he will get it. He’s
    not spoiled—he’s just persistent. And his focus and intensity have made him seem
    very lucky. For example, when he was just seventeen, he decided he wanted to study
    with the great evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr at Harvard—and he was going to
    make it happen no matter what.[*](45_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1) He flew in from
    Alaska and showed up at Mayr’s office. His passion was so convincing that Mayr
    invited him to stay—and Barnaby may be the only person who ever studied at Harvard
    without SATs, grade transcripts, or teacher evaluations.[*](46_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_2)

  zh: 巴纳比特别喜欢爱迪生，因为他与这位伟大发明家的执着精神相似。他相信，只要他足够热切地想要某样东西，他一定会得到它。他不是被宠坏了——他只是非常坚持。而他的专注和强度使得他看起来非常幸运。例如，当他只有十七岁时，他决定要和伟大的进化生物学家恩斯特·迈尔一起在哈佛学习——而且无论如何他都要实现这个目标。[*](45_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1)他从阿拉斯加飞到哈佛，出现在迈尔的办公室。他的热情如此打动人，以至于迈尔邀请他留下来——巴纳比可能是唯一一个没有SAT成绩、没有成绩单或教师评价就能在哈佛学习的人。[*](46_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_2)

    to so many people that it’s hard to know who actually said it. Probably all of
    them—from Thomas Jefferson to Samuel Goldwyn to Oprah—would agree with it. But

    translates to luck. Were the hardest-working people really the luckiest?

- en: The connection turns out to be subtler than it seems. The persistence and focus
    that lead to luck come in many forms—and don’t necessarily equate to hours put

    and New Age guru. As a scientist, Barnaby had initially been a little wary of
    meeting him because Chopra’s ideas on alternative medicine have been attacked
    by many mainstream scientists. But as he got to know Chopra over several months,
    Barnaby was won over by Chopra’s openness toward a bigger picture of reality and
    his insights into how we can exert control over our own lives. Through his inspirational
    talks, Chopra shares the idea that we can make things happen for ourselves by
    our own thoughts and attitudes.

  zh: 巴纳比和他的新朋友、灵性导师兼新时代大师迪帕克·乔普拉共度了一个上午。作为一名科学家，巴纳比起初对与他见面有些警惕，因为乔普拉关于替代医学的观点曾遭到许多主流科学家的攻击。但在与乔普拉相识几个月后，巴纳比被乔普拉对更广阔现实图景的开放态度和他关于我们如何掌控自己生活的洞察力所打动。通过他的启发性演讲，乔普拉分享了一个观点——我们可以通过自己的思想和态度让事情发生。
- en: I had learned that telling other people in your networks and community what
    you want could cause lucky connections and breaks to happen, but I had a hard
    time believing the cultural gurus who suggested that if you simply whisper your
    desires to the universe, then the universe will (mysteriously) respond. But Barnaby
    said that Chopra had a deeper approach that was worth considering.

- en: “He suggests that you start each day with a routine of calm focus where you
    ask yourself, ‘Who am I?’ and ‘What do I want?’” Barnaby told me. “That way you

    get something—whether a job, a lover, or a good deal on a new Prius—you’ll try
    hard and perhaps never give up. The grit and fortitude and steely resolve that
    come with being passionate make positive things happen. Putting your desire out
    to the universe just means that you know what you want. Once you’ve declared it
    to yourself, you’re more likely to aim your energy and emotion in the right direction.

- en: When I started investigating, I discovered that these ideas aren’t off-the-wall
    or New Agey at all. You don’t get more respected and mainstream than Nobel Prize
    winner Daniel Kahneman, and some of his research suggested that simply *wanting*
    can change your luck for *getting*. So, for example, in analyzing one study, he
    found that people who said when they were eighteen years old that being very well-off
    financially was important to them ended up wealthier twenty years later than others.

  zh: 当我开始调查时，我发现这些观点根本不是空穴来风或是新时代的迷信。没有比诺贝尔奖得主丹尼尔·卡尼曼更受尊敬、主流的人物了，他的一些研究表明，单单是*渴望*也能改变你*获得*的运气。例如，在分析一项研究时，他发现那些在十八岁时表示财务状况非常好对他们来说很重要的人，二十年后比其他人更富有。

    over twenty years, beginning when they were just starting at elite universities.
    The initial questionnaire had students use a four-point scale to rank how much
    they cared about money. On the follow-up twenty years later, Kahneman looked at
    one group and discovered that for every extra point they had given on the money-importance
    scale, they were making an additional $14,000 in income—the equivalent of more
    than $22,100 today.

- en: It’s a pretty striking result. Announcing as a teenager that you’re a four rather
    than a three on the want-to-be-rich scale results in a luck bonus that’s enough
    to buy a new Honda every year. Most of us wouldn’t mind that kind of lucky input
    to our own bank accounts. And we can all make that kind of luck. If you’ve told
    yourself at age eighteen (or any other age) that having money is a top goal, you’re
    going to set yourself on a course (consciously or unconsciously) to make that
    happen. You’ll put in serious effort, get to know the right people, and land an
    entry-level job when you graduate that allows you to rent your own apartment.
    Your parents’ friends (whose children are all back living at home) will wonder
    how you got so lucky. You can tell them that in order to find a pot of gold, you
    need to identify it. Only then can you can follow the right rainbow.

  zh: 这是一个相当引人注目的结果。作为青少年时宣布自己在“想要富有”这条尺度上得分四分，而不是三分，会带来足够的运气奖励，足以每年买一辆新本田。我们大多数人都不介意自己银行账户里有这种幸运的输入。而且我们每个人都可以创造这种运气。如果你在十八岁（或任何其他年龄）时告诉自己，拥有财富是最重要的目标，那么你就会有意识或无意识地为实现这一目标设定方向。你会投入真正的努力，结识正确的人，在毕业时找到一份入门级工作，能够租一间属于自己的公寓。你父母的朋友（他们的孩子们都还住在家里）会好奇你是如何这么幸运的。你可以告诉他们，为了找到一桶金，你必须先识别它。只有这样，你才能跟随正确的彩虹。
- en: The study Kahneman analyzed didn’t ask the eighteen-year-olds how important
    it was to them to become parents, work in the fashion world, star in a TV show,
    or volunteer in Ghana. But if it had, I’d be happy to bet that those who ranked
    any one of those options as a four-out-of-four in desirability would be more likely
    to achieve it than those not as driven. Once you’ve acknowledged to yourself what
    you consider a lucky life, you start putting into place all the pieces to get

    successes than we like to admit. A lot of things we find miraculous (“I was walking

    percent of the time and one who succeeds only 1 percent of the time. Sometimes
    the less talented person can seem to be incredibly lucky at landing a great job
    or acting part or loving spouse. But there’s a good chance that he’s changed his
    odds by not giving up and so having more at bats. “If you try a hundred times,
    you might very well succeed, because then statistics are on your side,” Mlodinow
    said. “It’s how you turn a 1 percent person into a 99 percent person.” In other
    words, the less obviously talented person who tries a hundred times can have the
    same success as the superstar who tries only once.

- en: As the child of Holocaust survivors, Mlodinow understands at his core that we
    can’t control everything and are sometimes caught in swirls of history much bigger
    than ourselves. He also recognizes the power of randomness in daily life and admits
    that he likes to trace back the instances that made a difference—and how they
    occurred. We can all do that. If you left your office a moment earlier, you might
    have been hit by the drunk driver rather than watching the accident happen to
    the guy in front of you. Or if you hadn’t sat a little longer to have an extra
    cup of coffee, you wouldn’t have met the person who became your best friend. Physicists
    are very good at seeing life as Brownian motion writ large—humans being the equivalents

- en: Scientists have been fascinated by this kind of motion since the Roman poet
    and philosopher Lucretius wrote about it in 60 BCE. He described looking at the
    dust particles in a sunbeam streaking into a building and realizing that “their
    dancing is an actual indication of underlying movements of matter that are hidden
    from our sight.” Albert Einstein and others later brought some mathematical precision
    to the mystery, making the causes of the dancing less hidden. In real life, we
    may be tossed in Brownian motion, but that’s not the end of the story. As Mlodinow

    producer Doug Wick.[*](47_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_3) A red, industrial staircase
    outside led to a lobby with a wooden-planked reception desk. Two handsome guys
    in their early twenties, both with perfect three-day stubble, welcomed me and
    said that Doug was running a little late (de rigueur in Hollywood). While waiting
    for him, I went into a bathroom that was the size of a small apartment and had
    a gorgeous kimono encased in plexiglass filling one wall. Doug later told me it
    had been a gift from Steven Spielberg, his coproducer on the movie *Memoirs of
    a Geisha*.

    from the 1988 hit *Working Girl* to the recent sci-fi favorite *Divergent*. He
    had wanted to be a producer for as long as he could remember and told me that

    miracle. One company uses what it calls “neural networks” to analyze scripts with
    more than a hundred different components to determine if the resulting movie will
    be a box-office success. Back in 2004, a guy named Ryan Kavanaugh started Relativity
    Media on what he called a “Monte Carlo model”—a risk-assessment algorithm (borrowed
    from Wall Street) that looked at past performance and churned through tens of
    thousands of combinations of actors, director, budget, release date, genre, and

    different themes cycled back led him to decide to do *Gladiator* with Russell
    Crowe. But when he first pitched it to Sony, “an executive there lectured me that
    swords and sandals was dead,” he said. He was in good company for being rejected.
    Two studios turned down the original *Star Wars* before 20th Century Fox made
    billions of dollars with it. Steven Spielberg’s *E.T.* was snubbed by a studio

    work. He nodded, pointing out that his good luck started when he grew up in a
    family where curiosity, humor, and intellect were all part of the mix. “The home
    environment is the primordial soup from which personality emerges,” he said. His
    mother was an early believer in finding a passion and pursuing it to create a
    lucky life. “She used to say, ‘You can be whatever you want as long as you’re
    happy. You can be a garbageman as long as you’re the best one.’ I told her, ‘I’m
    sloppy, so it will be hard to be number one at that.’”

    and the opportunities you can create. “When I talk to young people, I tell them

  zh: “第一次看到*汉密尔顿*时，我非常喜欢，甚至激动得流泪了，”他说。“林看着我问，‘你还好吗？’”林-曼努尔·米兰达，*汉密尔顿*的广受赞誉的创作者，刚刚给了他扮演乔治国王的角色。格罗夫简直不敢相信自己的好运。
- en: Groff’s luck hadn’t fallen from the sky—it evolved from burning desire. Growing
    up as the son of a Mennonite and a Methodist in conservative Lancaster, Pennsylvania,
    he wasn’t exactly raised to think of acting as a high calling. But he sang in
    local productions and knew that he loved the stage. Like many would-be stars,
    he said good-bye to his hometown after high school and set off on his dream. Coming
    to New York, he took acting classes and got a job as a waiter at a restaurant
    called the Chelsea Grill. It was a good choice—since it happened to be a hangout
    for theater types.

  zh: 格罗夫的好运并非从天而降——它源自于他强烈的渴望。作为宾夕法尼亚州保守的兰开斯特市一位门诺派和一位卫理公会信徒的儿子，他并非从小就被教导把表演视为崇高的职业。但他曾在本地的演出中唱歌，并且知道自己热爱舞台。像许多潜在的明星一样，他在高中毕业后告别了故乡，踏上了追逐梦想的道路。来到纽约后，他参加了表演课程，并在一家名为切尔西烧烤的餐厅找到了一份服务员工作。这是一个不错的选择——因为那正是剧院圈子的人们的聚集地。
- en: “A guy at my table one night said, ‘You must be an actor—would you like to see
    the ends of shows and collect money in buckets afterward?’” Groff recalled. The
    offer wasn’t as strange as it may sound since the guy ran the nonprofit Broadway
    Cares, which raises money for the sick and needy in the theater community. For
    a few weeks every year, actors stay onstage after their curtain calls and make
    a pitch to support the cause. As the audience streams out, volunteers in the lobby
    hold out collection buckets.

  zh: “有一天晚上我桌子旁的一个人说，‘你一定是个演员——你想在演出结束后拿着桶收钱吗？’”格罗夫回忆道。这个提议听起来或许很奇怪，但实际上并不那么陌生，因为那个人经营着非营利组织百老汇关怀，它筹集资金帮助剧院社区中的病人和贫困者。每年有几周时间，演员们会在谢幕后留在舞台上，为这个事业做宣传。当观众们离场时，志愿者们会在大厅里举着募捐桶。
- en: Groff was thrilled at the chance to be a bucket boy. He juggled his schedule
    of acting classes and waiting tables to show up for (volunteer) bucket duty almost
    every night. “So I was hanging around theaters and getting to know people just
    at the time that *Spring Awakening* was coming,” said Groff of the show that was
    to become a huge hit. “They were looking to cast kids in their teens and early
    twenties, and there I was.”

  zh: 格罗夫很兴奋能有机会做“桶男孩”。他在演技课程和等餐的时间表之间穿梭，几乎每晚都会去做（志愿者）桶的工作。“我就那时候在剧院周围闲逛，认识了一些人，而*春之觉醒*也正好在那时开始了，”格罗夫回忆道，那部剧后来成为了大热的作品。“他们在找一些十几岁和二十岁出头的年轻人，而我就在那儿。”
- en: Yes, there he was. He got the lead role and scored his first Tony nomination
    (this was his second) when he had barely reached drinking age.

  zh: 是的，他就在那里。他获得了主演角色，并在尚未满饮酒年龄时就获得了他的第一次托尼奖提名（这是他的第二次提名）。
- en: In Groff’s energetic telling, the leap from bucket boy to breakout star was
    random luck. Hang around the theaters, meet some people, and boom! You’re a star.
    But Groff had been putting the pieces in place since he was in fourth grade. He
    had been so passionate about singing when he was in elementary school that “I
    recorded the Tony Awards on VHS tape and brought it to school to play for everyone
    in math class. I couldn’t believe people could sing like that. It made me so joyful!”

  zh: 在格罗夫充满活力的讲述中，从桶男孩到一夜成名的故事，充满了偶然的好运。呆在剧院，结识一些人，然后嘭！你就成了明星。但格罗夫自四年级开始就已经在为这一天铺路了。他从小就对唱歌充满热情，以至于“我录下了托尼奖的录像带，带到学校在数学课上给大家播放。我简直不敢相信有人能唱得那么好，那个时候我感到无比的快乐！”
- en: His passion would have been as obvious to a guy ordering a steak sandwich at
    the Chelsea Grill as it was to the casting agent for *Spring Awakening*. Getting
    lucky often requires sticking with something long after others would quit. If
    you love what you do and deeply believe in it, you’re less likely to get discouraged.
    Holding a bucket (even for a good cause) could feel tedious or even demeaning
    to a lot of people, but if you see it as part of a bigger framework, you’ll do
    it with energy, passion, and perseverance. And that’s what might make you lucky.

  zh: 他的热情无论是在切尔西烤肉店点牛排三明治的顾客面前，还是在*春之觉醒*的选角代理面前，都显而易见。幸运往往需要在别人放弃之后，继续坚持。如果你热爱你所做的事，并且深信不疑，你就不容易灰心丧气。拿着一个桶（即使是为了一个好原因）对很多人来说可能会觉得乏味甚至有些屈辱，但如果你把它当作更大框架的一部分，你就会充满能量、激情和毅力去做。这也许正是让你变得幸运的原因。
- en: Groff had spent way too long talking with me, and since the publicist was getting
    anxious, I wished him luck and sent him to other reporters who were waiting. I
    watched as he hugged a few people and grabbed a bottle of water—and it occurred
    to me that if luck happens at the intersection of chance, talent, and hard work,
    he had them all. He was a great example of all the principles Barnaby and I had
    been discovering. He put himself in a place where good things could happen (which
    wasn’t Lancaster) and looked for every possibility. He knew what he wanted, so
    when opportunities came, he grabbed them. He had the skills to shine on Broadway—terrific
    voice and acting chops, winning personality, and adorably curly hair (not required,
    but nice). Add to that the hard work he was willing to put in to achieve his goals,
    and it’s not a surprise that he was a return invitee at the Tony breakfast. He
    might have liked to focus on the random chance of being a bucket boy—but really
    that was the least important element in the whole story.

  zh: 格罗夫和我谈了太久，由于宣传人员变得焦急，我祝他好运，并把他送往其他正在等待的记者。我看着他拥抱了几个人，拿了一瓶水——然后我突然意识到，如果运气出现在机遇、天赋和努力工作的交汇点上，他三者兼具。他是巴纳比和我一直在发现的所有原则的绝佳例子。他把自己置身于一个能够发生好事的地方（那可不是兰开斯特），并寻找每一个可能性。他知道自己想要什么，所以当机会到来时，他抓住了它们。他具备在百老汇闪耀的技能——出色的嗓音和演技，迷人的个性，还有那一头可爱的卷发（虽然不是必须的，但很加分）。再加上他为实现目标愿意付出的努力，难怪他能成为托尼早餐会的回头客。他可能喜欢专注于做个“水桶男孩”的偶然性——但实际上那只是整个故事中最不重要的元素。

- en: Talking to Jonathan Groff and Bob Mankoff and Leonard Mlodinow and Marty Seligman
    had convinced me that any of us can create a lucky personality. Passion, persistence,
    and optimism don’t guarantee luck—but it’s pretty hard to be consistently lucky
    without them. They are essentials to what Mankoff poetically called the “pilot
    light of life.” They light the fire that needs to keep burning brightly for luck
    to emerge.

  zh: 与乔纳森·格罗夫、鲍勃·曼科夫、伦纳德·姆洛迪诺夫和马蒂·塞利格曼交谈让我确信，我们每个人都能培养出一个幸运的个性。激情、坚持和乐观并不能保证幸运——但没有它们，想要持续保持幸运几乎是不可能的。它们是曼科夫诗意地称之为“生活的指示灯”的必要元素。它们点燃了那团火焰，只有它持续明亮地燃烧，幸运才能显现。
