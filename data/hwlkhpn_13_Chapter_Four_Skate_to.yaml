- en: After spending Mondays and Tuesdays at his Luck Lab in Princeton, Barnaby would
    come to our weekly Wednesday get-togethers full of new ideas and theories. The
    first question when he came to New York was always where we would meet. I had
    one or two favorite spots in the city, but now the range of my hangouts expanded
    dramatically. A new restaurant in Columbus Circle, the Loeb Boathouse in Central
    Park, a coffee bar on the West Side—Barnaby was always looking for someplace better
    than where he’d been before.

    down in one of those shared workspaces that have been proliferating in big cities.

    about five hours a day watching TV in one form or another, plus another two hours
    or so consuming media on their phones and tablets. Seven hours a day is pretty
    much a full-time job. But unless you’re prepping to be a judge on *Dancing with
    the Stars*, you’re not going to get lucky by sitting home and watching television.

- en: Gretzky’s line about skating to where the puck would be was funny but also practical
    and true, because when the puck got to him, he was ready—and also often the only
    one there. You can score all sorts of (real and proverbial) goals by being in
    the right place for positive things to happen—whether you’re looking for a job,
    a spouse, or a sports trophy. I’d already learned that lucky events aren’t nearly
    as haphazard as they may appear. Being in the right place at the right time can
    be a matter of sheer chance, but just as often, some reasoned trajectory got you
    to that spot. If you’re trying to get lucky, you have to think about where you’re
    headed—and where the puck will be.

  zh: 格雷茨基说过“去冰球将要出现的地方滑行”这句话既幽默又实际，因为当冰球来到他面前时，他已经准备好了——而且往往是唯一一个在那里的人。无论你是在找工作、配偶还是体育奖杯，在正确的地方等待积极的事情发生，你就能达成各种（真实的或隐喻的）目标。我早已意识到，幸运的事件并不像看起来那样随机。虽然身处正确的时间和地点可能是纯粹的偶然，但往往，一条有意义的轨迹把你带到了那个位置。如果你想要获得好运，你必须考虑你要去哪里——以及冰球将会出现在哪里。
- en: I thought of a story I’d heard about Oscar-winning actress Charlize Theron,
    who left her home country of South Africa after a string of bad events in an unusually
    dramatic childhood. Her mother shot and killed Theron’s alcoholic father in self-defense
    (there were no charges), and Theron moved to Italy and then America, looking for
    better luck. It didn’t happen immediately. She wanted to be a dancer, but her
    knees gave out. She was so depressed that her mother told her to come back home,
    but at age nineteen, she went to Los Angeles to give herself one last chance.
    It wasn’t looking good—until she had a screaming fit in a bank when a teller refused
    to cash the check her mom had sent from South Africa.

- en: Now I’m not suggesting that exploding in rage is the way to get lucky. But by
    dragging herself to Los Angeles after all that had gone wrong, Theron put herself
    in a place where opportunities were most likely to happen. If she’d given up and
    gone back to South Africa, everyone at home would have understood and consoled
    her on her hard luck. Instead, she gave herself the chance to get lucky—and the
    2004 Academy Award for Best Actress ended up on her mantel rather than someone
    else’s.

  zh: 现在我并不是说爆发愤怒是获得好运的方式。但是，赛隆在经历了所有的挫折后拖着自己去洛杉矶，让自己置身于最有可能发生机会的地方。如果她放弃了，回到南非，家里的人都会理解并安慰她的坏运气。相反，她给了自己一个获得好运的机会——最终，2004年奥斯卡最佳女演员奖落在了她的
    mantel 上，而不是其他人的。
- en: Americans have a reputation for being always on the go, but it turns out that
    making big moves like Theron did is unusual here. According to an analysis in
    *The* *New York Times*, a scant 20 percent of Americans live more than a couple
    of hours’ drive away from their moms, and half of all grown-ups in the country
    stay within eighteen miles of those moms.[*](37_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1) I am

    away from Mom can lead to new connections and better possibilities.

    You can move to Los Angeles planning to audition for commercials, but instead
    you throw a tantrum in a bank, get an agent, take acting classes, and end up playing
    a serious role that wins you an Oscar. Each of those events (the tantrum in the
    bank, getting an agent . . .) could have numerous different outcomes, and one
    doesn’t lead inexorably to the next. You have to see the possibility and grab

- en: Barnaby was full of examples of people who had made luck by going where the
    opportunities would be. The Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis didn’t start
    out lucky—his family lost everything during the Greco-Turkish War, and he fled
    to Buenos Aires as a teenager. But even when Onassis was too broke to eat out,
    he would go to the most expensive hotel and order tea.

    so that he could listen in on other people’s business calls and figure out his
    own angles. He always put himself in a place where he could meet the people who
    would help him. It’s probably excessive to say that this rule led him to be one
    of the richest men in the world, the lover of opera diva Maria Callas, and the
    husband to widowed Jacqueline Kennedy. But the determined effort to make his own
    luck certainly helped him rebound, and his go-for-it principles still resonate.

- en: I probably wouldn’t use my last dime for tea in a fancy hotel, but maybe that’s
    why I’m not as rich as Onassis. To get lucky, you have to be in a place where
    you can make opportunities. It’s always easy to find reasons and excuses not to
    do something, and a defeatist attitude can sometimes even seem like the rational
    one. Maybe it is. But it’s not the one that will make you lucky.

    Teresa lived in India and dedicated her life to the people she described as the
    unwanted, unloved, and uncared for in society. She started a congregation called
    the Missionaries of Charity, which expanded rapidly over the years, and by the
    time she died in 1997, it included thousands of nuns in more than a hundred countries,
    all of them vowing to give “wholehearted free service to the poorest of the poor.”

- en: Mother Teresa quickly figured out that you need a lot of money to take care
    of the poor and forgotten—and she was intent on gathering charitable donations.
    Though she believed that understanding the poor meant living among them, she often
    flew in the first-class cabin of airplanes. She got some criticism for that, but
    being in the front of the plane on her frequent travels ultimately brought luck
    that she could spread far. Talking to people on long flights from India to London
    (and elsewhere) gave her a captive fund-raising audience and generated some of
    her biggest contributions. She understood that the executive who could afford
    seat 1A was probably more able to contribute generously to her cause than the
    guy in the middle seat of the last row in economy. In person, this small and intent
    woman was hard to turn down. Her passion was her power.

- en: Mother Teresa was canonized by the Catholic Church in 2016 as Saint Teresa of
    Calcutta. The canonization caused some controversy (though it didn’t mention her
    travel arrangements), and even in her down-to-earth days, critics sometimes pointed
    out her many connections with dubious (albeit rich) executives and dictators.
    More positively, she did whatever was necessary to help fund her important activities
    and bring some luck to the neediest. Sometimes she found the people who could
    help in India and sometimes at international meetings and sometimes just walking

    Looking for investments, Parker went to Reid Hoffman, who headed the social networking

    “ideal free distribution”—noting that more animals gather in the spots richest
    in resources. For a squirrel, a grassy area with lots of nuts and fruits scattered
    on the ground might seem like the perfect place to hang out. But if all the other
    squirrels are there too, and you’re on the small side and don’t have sharp claws,

    in 2010 and went to Stanford to get a graduate degree in mechanical engineering.
    She was one of the few women in the program, and fired up by the entrepreneurial
    spirit encouraged at Stanford, she decided she wanted to create a toy for little
    girls that encouraged them to be as excited about engineering as she was. She
    imagined a toy where little girls could design a project and then build and wire
    it.

    and, along with her friend Bettina Chen, who was also in the engineering program,
    decided to start a company. A great idea—but then, everybody in Silicon Valley
    has a great idea. They worked every element in the luck chain to make the idea
    a success—finding the right contacts, crowdsourcing, getting mentors, being out
    in the marketplace where chance events could occur. Then they got themselves into
    a position where many entrepreneurs want to be—on the TV show *Shark Tank*.

  zh: 在斯坦福，她开始设计有闪光灯和电路的女孩玩具，并与她的朋友贝蒂娜·陈一起（她也在工程项目中），决定创办一家公司。一个好主意——但在硅谷，人人都有好主意。他们发挥了所有运气链条中的元素来让这个想法成功——寻找合适的联系人，进行众筹，寻找导师，在市场上寻找可能的机会事件。然后，他们把自己置于许多创业者都希望达到的位置——参加电视节目*Shark
    Tank*。
- en: If you’ve never watched that program, you have to trust me that it’s a lot more
    entertaining than it might sound. The “sharks” are five hugely successful businesspeople
    (“titans of industry,” the show calls them) who listen to pitches from entrepreneurs
    and decide if they want to invest money (their own) in the start-up companies.
    Produced by Mark Burnett, who launched into reality television years ago with
    the show *Survivor*, *Shark Tank* is a kind of *Survivor* for capitalists. The
    show has gotten so popular that the producers get some forty thousand applications
    every year from people who want to swim into the tank. But they also go out looking
    for entrepreneurs who would make good TV—and it didn’t take them long to hear
    about two attractive Stanford engineers making a smart toy for girls.

  zh: 如果你从未看过这个节目，你必须相信我，它比听起来要有趣得多。“鲨鱼”是五位非常成功的商业人士（节目称他们为“行业巨头”），他们听取企业家的投资提案，并决定是否将自己的钱投资于这些初创公司。该节目由马克·伯内特制作，他几年前通过真人秀节目*幸存者*进入了电视界，*Shark
    Tank*是资本家版的*幸存者*。该节目已经变得非常受欢迎，以至于制作方每年都会收到大约四万份来自希望进入“鲨池”的申请。但他们也会主动寻找那些可能成为好电视节目的企业家——很快他们就听说了两位来自斯坦福大学的迷人工程师，她们正在为女孩制作一款聪明的玩具。
- en: Brooks told me she was flattered the first time the producers called, but she
    turned them down. She recognized that while the show was meant to be fun for viewers,
    the sharks were also shrewd businesspeople looking to invest with savvy entrepreneurs
    who had potentially profitable companies. She’d get one chance to impress them.
    Being in the right place doesn’t help if you’re not ready to take full advantage
    of the opportunity. She wanted her company to have bigger sales and a more impressive
    story before she went on the show.

  zh: 布鲁克斯告诉我，当制作人第一次打电话来时，她感到很受宠若惊，但她拒绝了他们的邀请。她意识到，虽然节目本意是让观众娱乐，但“鲨鱼”们也是精明的商人，寻找那些有潜力和有利可图的企业家来投资。她知道她只有一次机会打动他们。如果你没有准备好充分利用这个机会，即使身处正确的位置也无济于事。她希望她的公司在上节目之前能有更大的销售额和更引人注目的故事。
- en: Finally the company was in a position where she felt ready to say yes to the
    producers. “We were going to be the first episode on season six, so we watched
    the previous five seasons and took notes on every question that got asked,” Alice
    said. “Then we divided up the questions so that when we were asked something,
    we could answer immediately and not have to look at each other.”

- en: Being on that TV show was definitely the right place—and their smooth presentation
    and quick answers impressed the group. The results were a great example of luck
    favoring the prepared. Billionaire Mark Cuban invested $250,000, for 2.5 percent
    of their company.[*](39_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_3) They already had sales of $1.7
    million when they appeared on the show, and those soared to some $5 million the
    following year. A few years later, in January 2016, they sold out to a Wisconsin-based
    toy company—making Brooks very rich before her thirtieth birthday.

    当他们出现在节目时，公司的销售额已经达到了170万美元，接下来的年份，这个数字飙升到大约500万美元。几年后，在2016年1月，他们将公司卖给了一家位于威斯康星州的玩具公司——在她三十岁之前，布鲁克斯变得非常富有。

    to where the puck has *already been*. In looking for luck or success, it’s natural

    Start-up companies are always talking about their beta version—which means they’re
    still trying stuff out and looking for ways to improve. Or they say they’re in
    Version 2.0—which means the first plan didn’t work and they’ve moved on to another
    one. Both of these approaches are valuable for your own life, too. When the rules

    he has eclectic interests?), and as we talked one day, he brought up a bird called
    the rock dove that used to live on the Mediterranean coast in Europe and North
    Africa. As cities grew, there were more chances to get lucky finding food away
    from the coast, and many of the doves moved inland. They continued to follow opportunities

    the ornate molding of a very nice building on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan was a
    good place for his nest. Named Pale Male by a writer, he became a local celebrity
    when the wealthy residents of the building decided they didn’t want him there—and
    dismantled the nest. Bird enthusiasts and the Audubon Society intervened, and
    eventually the nest was rebuilt with a reported $40,000 supporting platform beneath
    it (to keep any debris from falling on pedestrians below). Pale Male has now been
    at his penthouse perch more than twenty-five years, and with a succession of mates
    (eight, at last count) has sent many offspring into the world. There are now reports

    for the qualifying rounds and they missed their quarter-final contests. There
    was no pleading the case—they were eliminated. That story resonates over the decades
    because it seems so outrageously unfair. Even those who never previously heard
    of Robinson and Hart know that they must have driven themselves and trained for
    years in order to make the Olympics in the first place. The coach took the fall

    hockey—“You miss 100 percent of the shots you don’t take.” In other words, you
    can’t get lucky unless you put yourself on the line. And for that, it’s necessary
    to pull yourself out of a comfort zone (and definitely out of bed) and meet the
