- en: Spending a warm May weekend on campus for my college reunion, I slipped away
    from the socializing one afternoon and sat in the back of a classroom as a young
    professor of geology named Maureen Long talked about earthquakes. And tsunamis.
    And other problems related to natural disasters. I left thinking I should have
    been a geology major—which clearly shows what a good teacher she is.

  zh: 在一个温暖的五月周末，我回到学校参加校友聚会，某个下午我偷偷溜出社交活动，坐在一间教室的后排，聆听一位名叫莫琳·朗（Maureen Long）的年轻地质学教授讲解地震。还有海啸。以及其他与自然灾害相关的问题。讲座结束后，我觉得自己应该选择地质学专业——这显然是她作为好老师的表现。
- en: When I saw Barnaby the next week, I mentioned that her lecture had inspired
    me to think about who survives natural disasters and who doesn’t. Was it simply
    random chance, or did the survivors do something right to prepare? There had to
    be a way to increase your luck in these unluckiest of situations.

    shocking each time they occur, but they happen fairly regularly.[*](74_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1)

- en: I gave a little laugh—I had yet to find a topic that Barnaby didn’t have some
    experience with. He explained that his mom had trained in arts and design and
    knew nothing about seismic science, but she was spirited and entrepreneurial and
    got the Alaska job anyway. She learned the science quickly and tried to raise
    earthquake awareness through programs in schools and public brochures. But she
    was stymied at every turn by powerful people who owned land and property in vulnerable
    spots—and didn’t want the topic discussed.

  zh: 我轻笑了一下——我还没有找到巴纳比没有经历过的话题。他解释说，妈妈曾接受过艺术和设计训练，对地震科学一无所知，但她很有活力且具有创业精神，最终还是得到了阿拉斯加的工作。她迅速学习了地震科学，并通过学校项目和公共宣传册努力提高地震意识。但她在每一步都被那些拥有易受灾土地和财产的有权势的人阻碍——他们不希望这个话题被讨论。
- en: “Alaska is on the Ring of Fire—which is basically the most earthquake-prone
    set of plates in the world,” Barnaby told me. A great earthquake that struck on
    Good Friday of 1964 was the most powerful in the history of America and the second-most
    powerful ever recorded in the world (9.2 on the Richter scale). Given Alaska’s
    sparse population, casualties were limited, though more than a hundred people
    died in the tsunamis that followed.

  zh: “阿拉斯加位于环太平洋地震带——这基本上是世界上最容易发生地震的板块，”巴纳比（Barnaby）告诉我。1964年复活节星期五发生的一次大地震是美国历史上最强的地震，也是世界历史上第二强的地震（震中强度为9.2级）。由于阿拉斯加人口稀少，伤亡人数相对较少，但超过一百人在随后的海啸中丧生。
- en: “There was extensive damage in downtown Anchorage, but just a few hours after
    the quake, an influential property developer named Wally Hickel announced he would
    rebuild,” Barnaby said. “Geologists urged him not to, but he put up a luxury hotel,
    anyway.”[*](75_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_2)

  zh: “安克雷奇市区遭受了严重损坏，但地震发生后仅几个小时，一位名叫沃利·希克尔（Wally Hickel）的有影响力的房地产开发商宣布他将重建，”巴纳比说。“地质学家劝他不要这么做，但他还是建起了一座豪华酒店。”[*](75_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_2)
- en: Maybe it’s not so surprising that a developer/politician who puts his name on
    buildings values his own profits—and ignores long-term consequences. When he eventually
    ran for office, people liked Hickel’s promises of prosperity and he became governor.
    His legacy of supporting business may seem less reasonable if another earthquake
    sweeps through.

  zh: 也许并不奇怪，一位将自己名字刻在建筑物上的开发商/政治家会重视自己的利润——并忽视长期后果。当他最终竞选公职时，人们喜欢希克尔（Hickel）关于繁荣的承诺，于是他当选为州长。如果另一场地震再次发生，他支持商业的遗产可能显得不那么合理。

    staying in hotels built on questionable land,” Barnaby advised.

    couldn’t find a single review of Hickel’s hotel on TripAdvisor that mentioned
    earthquakes. And why would anyone really think of that? If you want to play the
    odds, you figure that a big one isn’t going to strike just when you’re spending
    a night in Anchorage before your Alaskan cruise.

  zh: 在自然灾害方面，我们不太擅长未雨绸缪。我在TripAdvisor上找不到一条提到地震的关于希克尔酒店的评论。为什么有人会想到这个呢？如果你想计算概率，你就会认为大地震不会恰好发生在你在阿拉斯加巡游前在安克雷奇过夜的那一刻。
- en: But eventually the odds can go against you. A geophysicist named Mary Lou Zoback
    spent years trying to get the city of San Francisco to pay more attention to the
    earthquake readiness of its buildings, but like Barnaby’s mom, she came up against
    real estate interests worried about property values. “Eventually they realized
    there was some grassroots interest in the safety of buildings,” she told us.

  zh: 但最终，运气可能会不站在你这一边。一位名叫玛丽·露·佐巴克的地球物理学家花了多年时间试图让旧金山更加关注其建筑的抗震能力，但就像巴纳比的母亲一样，她遇到了担心房产价值的房地产利益。“最终他们意识到市民对建筑安全存在一些草根兴趣，”她告诉我们。
- en: The San Francisco earthquake of 1906 killed some 3,000 people, and more than
    a hundred years later, Zoback pointed out that some of the most popular spots
    in the city (like the marina and the financial district) are built in sensitive
    areas. During an earthquake, the buildings on top of them could be vulnerable.

- en: But better luck may be on the way. Laws have passed that require people to buttress

    to become a geophysicist when she was in eighth grade and took the standard course
    on earth science. She was captivated by plate tectonics, the study of the underlying
    structures of the earth. “I thought it was the coolest thing I’d ever heard of,”

- en: The movement of the plates leads to earthquakes and volcanoes, but Professor
    Long pointed out that they may have a lucky side, too. Other planets like Mars
    and Venus don’t have plate tectonics, and there’s the possibility that over millions
    and tens of millions of years, they contribute to our planet’s habitability.

  zh: 板块的运动导致了地震和火山爆发，但朗教授指出，它们也可能有幸运的一面。其他行星如火星和金星没有板块构造，而这些板块构造可能在数百万年、数千万年的时间里，助力我们星球的宜居性。
- en: “We’re trying to understand what it is about the Earth that leads to this very
    specific behavior, with the plates moving around and the oceanic crust getting
    recycled back into the mantle and building continents,” she said. “The fact that
    the Earth can exchange material between its interior and its oceans over millions
    of years might play a role in regulating the very long-term carbon cycle of the
    planet. It speaks to a lot of fundamental questions about what allowed life to
    develop.”

- en: That did sound pretty cool. And lucky, too. But on a shorter-term basis, the
    plate shiftings mean earthquakes are a lot more common than you think. There are
    about fifteen magnitude 7 earthquakes a year—and you don’t want to be around when
    one hits. Many of them happen far away from people and infrastructure, so we don’t
    hear about them on the evening news. But then comes one like the 2010 Haiti earthquake,
    which killed well over 100,000 people (some estimates go much higher) and offered
    a devastating reminder that poor infrastructure and a complete lack of preparedness
    can lead to very, very bad luck.

  zh: 这听起来确实很酷，也很幸运。但从短期来看，板块运动意味着地震比你想象的要常见得多。每年大约有十五次7级地震——而你可不想在其中一次发生时正好在场。很多地震发生在远离人类和基础设施的地方，因此我们在晚间新闻中听不到它们的消息。但像2010年海地地震这样的灾难却发生了，这次地震导致超过100,000人死亡（有些估计甚至更高），并且给我们上了深刻的一课，提醒我们基础设施的薄弱和完全没有准备会导致非常、非常不幸的结果。
- en: Tragedy often hits unexpectedly, but sometimes there are warning signals that
    can give you time to prepare. The earthquake that rumbled under the Indian Ocean
    in 2004 was a magnitude 9 (the third largest ever recorded) and unleashed a devastating
    tsunami. The first waves—really walls of water—that ravaged the coast of Thailand
    came quickly. Vacationers lolling on the beaches were submerged in the swirling
    water, and there was no obvious way to prepare to be lucky. But across the ocean,
    waves continued to propagate, and tens of thousands of fatalities occurred in
    places far away, many hours later. “You need systems in place ahead of time so
    people can be warned and evacuate,” said Professor Long. Without these systems,
    the tsunami killed some 250,000 people in fourteen countries.

  zh: 灾难往往来得措手不及，但有时也会有警告信号，让你有时间做好准备。2004年印度洋下发生的地震震级为9级（是历史上记录的第三大震级），引发了毁灭性的海啸。第一波海浪——实际上是巨大的水墙——迅速席卷了泰国海岸。正在沙滩上度假的游客被湮没在旋转的水流中，根本没有明显的办法提前做好准备。然而，海洋另一端，海浪继续传播，数万人的死亡发生在遥远的地方，许多小时之后。“你需要提前建立系统，让人们能够收到警告并进行撤离，”朗教授说。没有这些系统，这次海啸在十四个国家造成了大约250,000人的死亡。
- en: Scientists can’t yet predict where and when an earthquake will occur, but there
    are other ways to get warnings.[*](76_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_3) “You can sometimes
    get thirty, forty, or fifty seconds of warning, which doesn’t sound like a lot—but
    it means you can shut down the nuclear reactor and get the subway trains out of
    the tunnel. It’s a very exciting innovation.” The systems exist in Japan and are
    being developed in California and the Pacific Northwest. The advance notice means
    you might get lucky enough to move to a doorframe or duck under a table and avoid

    plan—like early warning systems and safer building codes. But when the governments

- en: Barnaby suggested we talk to Laurence Gonzales, who has been writing about dangerous
    situations for years. He’s looked at everything from wilderness accidents to plane
    crashes, trying to understand who survives and who doesn’t. In a long conversation
    with him, we discovered that when it comes to disaster preparedness, Gonzales
    is a do-everything kind of guy. He told us that he and his wife had been at a
    doctor’s office the previous day when a fire alarm went off. She was writing a
    check at the reception desk “and she didn’t even hesitate. She dropped her checkbook,
    walked over to me, and we went straight to the exit and out. Was it a false alarm?

  zh: 巴纳比建议我们去找劳伦斯·冈萨雷斯（Laurence Gonzales）谈谈，他多年一直在写关于危险情况的文章。他考察过从荒野事故到飞机失事的一切，试图了解谁能幸存下来，谁又不能。在与他的长时间对话中，我们发现当谈到灾难应对时，冈萨雷斯是个“什么都做”的人。他告诉我们，前一天他和妻子在一家医生办公室里时，突然响起了火警警报。她正站在接待台写支票，“她甚至没有犹豫，丢下支票本，走过来找我，我们直接走到出口，跑了出去。那是误报吗？通常是。但如果警报响了，你就得离开建筑物。否则为什么要安装火警系统？”
- en: It’s a good point, but most of us *don’t* leave the building the moment we hear
    an alarm. We hesitate, we try to get more information, we see what everybody else
    is doing. Our instinct is to believe that everything is okay. Many years ago,
    my husband and I were asleep in our suburban home with our (then) very young children
    down the hall. At about three A.M., the burglar alarm sounded and the phone rang
    immediately, with our alarm company calling to check. My husband reached for the
    phone. “False alarm,” he said groggily, and he gave the code that said all was

- en: The psychoanalyst Stephen Grosz wouldn’t have been surprised. In his book *The
    Examined Life*, he points out how difficult it is for us to break our usual patterns.
    My husband is competent and self-sufficient, and those traits usually work out
    well. They are his instinctive fallback. He had never encountered an alarm in
    our home that *wasn’t* set off by mistake. But hearing an alarm in the middle
    of the night, he might have done better to try shutting off his natural instincts.
    Grosz said that in one nightclub fire, some people went to pay their checks before
    leaving and others died because they tried to leave through the door they entered.
    Oftentimes people simply linger too long—they may smell the smoke, but they wait
    to see the flames. “We resist change. Committing ourselves to a small change,
    even one that is unmistakably in our best interest, is often more frightening
    than ignoring a dangerous situation,” he said.

- en: Laurence Gonzales pointed out that we create mental models that let us acclimatize
    to almost anything. He described how his little granddaughter first saw a garbage
    truck when she was not yet two years old, and she was scared and excited as it
    roared by. But once she had seen the truck enough times, she stopped noticing
    it. “She incorporated it into a model that allows her to proceed through life
    efficiently,” he told us.

- en: As a grown-up, you can’t live happily—or make yourself lucky—if you’re stunned
    or scared by every event. You acclimatize. You recognize that not everything needs
    your attention. But sometimes you become so comfortable that you don’t realize
    when you’re facing danger. Gonzales told us that on the Gulf Coast of Texas, where
    he grew up, people would have hurricane parties. “You didn’t get out of town or
    go into a big building to protect yourself—you ordered a bunch of booze and had
    your friends over,” he said. Before one very big hurricane some years ago, the
    sheriff headed over to a row of apartment houses on a Galveston beach to warn
    people that the storm was coming and they needed to leave. One group that was
    partying on a fifth-floor balcony called back, “Hey, don’t sweat it, we do this
    every year”—and they just laughed and waved.

    rather be on the ground wishing I were in the air than in the air wishing I were

    things can happen to throw you off. Illness, death, and political upheaval (or
    kidnapping) can upend the best-laid plans. Things change, often unexpectedly.
    As the author Joan Didion wrote shortly after her husband collapsed in their living
    room from a massive heart attack:'

  zh: 无论你多么善于抓住机会过上幸运的生活，总有一些事情可能会让你失去方向。疾病、死亡和政治动荡（或绑架）可能会颠覆最精心策划的计划。事情会变化，往往是出人意料的。正如作者琼·迪迪恩在她的丈夫因心脏病突发倒在客厅后不久写道：

- en: Didion was struck by the ordinariness of tragedy. “Confronted with sudden disaster
    we all focus on how unremarkable the circumstances were in which the unthinkable
    occurred,” she said. Tragedy can come from the clear blue sky—often literally.
    The morning of September 11, 2001, was clear and cloudless, and people often describe
    the sunshine of that morning with a kind of awe—as if there should have been some
    greater warning, some black clouds and thunderstorms, before the planes struck
    the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.

  zh: 迪迪恩被悲剧的平凡性所震惊。“面对突如其来的灾难，我们都会专注于事情发生时那些不显眼的、平凡的环境，”她说。悲剧可以突然从晴空万里中降临——有时真的就是晴空万里。2001年9月11日的早晨，天气晴朗，万里无云，人们常常带着一种敬畏之情描述那天早晨的阳光——仿佛应该有某种更大的预警，某些黑云或雷暴，才会在飞机撞向世界贸易中心和五角大楼之前警示大家。
- en: For Dr. Sabeti, personal disaster also came on the day of a cloudless sky. Soon
    after the Ebola crisis, she was invited to give the opening talk at a conference
    of world leaders—the kind of event where politicians and celebrities and Silicon
    Valley stars and global leaders all gather. You can imagine Ashton Kutcher and
    the president of Mexico jamming with Senator Cory Booker and a high-tech CEO.
    In the mornings they hear smart talks and in the afternoons engage with one another
    in sports activities that Dr. Sabeti described as “insane and way too risky.”

  zh: 对于萨贝蒂博士来说，个人灾难也发生在一个晴空万里的日子里。在埃博拉危机后不久，她受邀在一个世界领导人会议上做开场演讲——这种活动聚集了政客、名人、硅谷明星和全球领导人。你可以想象，阿什顿·库彻和墨西哥总统与科里·布克参议员以及一位高科技CEO共同参与其中。早晨，他们听听聪明的演讲，下午则参加萨贝蒂博士形容为“疯狂且风险极大的”体育活动。
- en: Being a keynote speaker at this kind of gathering is a big deal, and Dr. Sabeti
    prepared for the day with an hour and a half of stretching and handstands “and
    other crazy stuff.” Her talk was extremely well received, and everyone was busy
    discussing it afterward and gathering around her. “People started weighing in
    on what I should do for the afternoon,” she said. Her original plan for rope climbing
    got shunted aside when she discovered a participant the previous year had shattered
    an ankle. So she switched to an ATV tour when she was told it was the safest option.

  zh: 成为这种活动的主旨演讲者是件大事，萨贝蒂博士为这一天做了一个半小时的伸展运动和倒立练习“以及其他疯狂的事情”。她的演讲获得了极好的反响，大家在会后都忙着讨论并围着她。
    “人们开始对我下午应该做什么发表意见，”她说。她原定的绳索攀登计划被搁置，因为她发现去年有一位参与者摔断了脚踝。于是，当她被告知四轮摩托车旅游是最安全的选择时，她便改为参加了这一活动。
- en: “Somehow in this context I just took it on face value and didn’t ask a lot of
    very specific questions about safety,” she said. “Little did I know that even
    though we were on a road, it was on the side of a two-hundred-foot drop. Basically
    the driver lost control and jumped out and we went over a cliff.”

  zh: “在这种情况下，我居然没有提出很多具体的安全问题，反而就默认了，”她说。“我不知道的是，虽然我们在一条路上行驶，但那条路就在一个200英尺的悬崖边。基本上，司机失控了，跳了出去，车子直接冲下了悬崖。”
- en: Thrown from the ATV, she was smashed against boulders that crushed her pelvis
    and knees and caused head injuries. Dr. Sabeti was flown from Montana to a trauma
    center in Seattle, where she went through twenty-five hours of surgery in four
    days. “Doctors said I had a 5 to 8 percent chance of survival. Most people with
    this kind of multiple trauma die. I’m one of the luckiest of the unluckiest.”

  zh: 她从全地形车（ATV）上被抛出，重重撞击到岩石，导致骨盆和膝盖骨折，并造成头部伤害。萨贝蒂博士从蒙大拿被空运到西雅图的创伤中心，在四天内接受了二十五小时的手术。“医生说我只有5%到8%的生还机会。大多数遭遇这种多重创伤的人都会死亡。我是最不幸中的幸运之一。”
- en: Given her experience in dealing with crises and disaster, Dr. Sabeti has played
    and replayed her own accident in her mind. Even in an unforeseeable situation,
    she thinks preparation helps—she was in such good shape that her tissue regenerated
    quickly, and her body was resilient enough to survive daily blood transfusions.

- en: “I have forty plates in my body, and I suffered a serious concussion where I
    couldn’t read for four months. My vision changed, and I have chronic vertigo.
    Most people in my condition never go back to work,” she said. But she is back
    in her lab, and though it took many months, she is again bubbling with ideas that
    she cares about.

- en: After any disaster—an earthquake or a hurricane, a plane crash or an Ebola outbreak
    or a devastating accident—the survivors don’t just pick up their lives where they
    left off. They are forever changed. They are stunned by the random chance that
    left them living and also slightly overwhelmed to realize that their own actions
    contributed to their fate. In the unluckiest of circumstances, they found a way
    to emerge as one of the lucky survivors. It is scary and sobering. Dr. Sabeti’s
    physical struggles may never go away. But she will continue making luck for herself
    and others.

  zh: 在任何灾难之后——不论是地震、飓风、飞机坠毁、埃博拉爆发还是灾难性事故——幸存者们不会只是把生活恢复到原先的状态。他们会永远改变。他们震惊于自己被命运眷顾，能够存活下来，同时也有些不知所措，意识到自己的行为也在某种程度上决定了命运。在最不幸的情况下，他们找到了一个方式，从绝望中脱颖而出，成为幸运的生还者。这是既可怕又使人深思的。萨贝蒂博士的身体困境可能永远不会消失，但她将继续为自己和他人创造幸运。
- en: Nobody wants to be in an earthquake or a hurricane, and not a lot of good comes
    from hotel fires or airplane crashes or devastating accidents. Being one of the
    lucky survivors can feel very random. But a willingness to prepare, think calmly,
    and involve your higher brain can give you the very narrow, lucky edge that just
    might make the difference.

  zh: 没有人愿意经历地震或飓风，酒店火灾、飞机坠毁或灾难性事故也没有什么好处。作为幸运的生还者之一，感觉非常随机。但愿意做好准备、冷静思考，并调动大脑高级功能，能给你一个非常狭窄的幸运优势，这个优势可能正是决定生死的关键。
