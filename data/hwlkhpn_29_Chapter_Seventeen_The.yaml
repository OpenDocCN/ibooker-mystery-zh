- en: Walking down the street one day, I realized that after all the time Barnaby
    and I had spent investigating luck, I was feeling luckier. I had been encouraging
    myself to recognize opportunities, make thoughtful moves, and persist when others
    quit. I was exhilarated by the idea that you have more control over all aspects
    of your life than you sometimes realize. No matter who you are, luck isn’t a given—you
    have to make it happen for yourself.

  zh: 一天走在街上，我意识到，在我和巴纳比花了这么多时间研究幸运之后，我感觉更幸运了。我一直在鼓励自己去识别机会，做出深思熟虑的举动，并在别人放弃时坚持下去。我为自己意识到，你对生活各个方面的控制比你有时意识到的要多而感到振奋。无论你是谁，幸运不是天生的——你必须为自己创造它。

    a lucky life.

    at me and laughed. “Quick answer, but unsatisfying, right?”

  zh: “我猜是实现你的梦想和潜力，”巴纳比说。然后他看着我笑了笑。“快速回答，但不太让人满足，对吧？”

    Somebody you would trade places with right now.”

  zh: “对，”我同意道，“这样试试。谁是你认为幸运人生的榜样？是那个你现在愿意和他交换位置的人。”
- en: He looked off into the distance for a couple of minutes, and I could practically
    see his brain ticking through various possibilities. I sipped iced tea. I waited.
    Finally I mentioned a couple of extremely wealthy people whom he had been hanging
    out with recently—flying on their planes, visiting their private islands, having
    meetings in their enormous townhouses. Barnaby knows a lot of billionaires, since
    he has advised many of them on how to make the greatest impact with their philanthropy.
    If you’re looking for people who’ve had a lucky life, they seemed a reasonable
    place to begin.

  zh: 他望向远方几分钟，我几乎能看到他的思维在迅速转动。我喝了口冰茶，等待着。最后我提到了一些他最近常和他们一起出入的极其富有的人——坐他们的飞机，访问他们的私人岛屿，在他们巨大的市区豪宅里开会。巴纳比认识很多亿万富翁，因为他曾为他们提供如何通过慈善事业产生最大影响的建议。如果你在寻找过得幸运的人，他们似乎是一个合理的起点。
- en: “I like them and admire what they can do in the world with their resources,”
    Barnaby said, “but as individuals they struggle just like the rest of us.” He
    mentioned that one had gone through a couple of divorces and another was having
    difficulties with a grown child. “They’ve been very successful in some ways, but
    have they made a luckier life overall? I don’t really know.”

  zh: “我喜欢他们，也钦佩他们能用自己的资源在世界上做出的贡献，”巴纳比说，“但作为个人，他们和我们其他人一样也在挣扎。”他提到其中一位经历了几次离婚，另一位与成年子女相处有困难。“他们在某些方面非常成功，但他们是否创造了更幸运的人生呢？我也不确定。”

- en: 'The last question in our national survey asked: “Do you think of yourself as
    a lucky person?” Some 67 percent of people said yes, and 33 percent said no. Barnaby
    and I wondered if specific factors made some people feel luckier than others.
    So he analyzed the data, looking for demographic differences, and he couldn’t
    find any. No matter where you lived, how much money you made, whether you were
    male or female, married or not, your chances of calling yourself a lucky person
    were about the same.'

  zh: 我们的全国调查的最后一个问题是：“你认为自己是个幸运的人吗？”约67%的人回答是，33%的人回答不是。巴纳比和我想知道是否有特定因素让一些人觉得比其他人更幸运。所以他分析了数据，寻找人口统计差异，但他没有发现任何差异。不管你住在哪里，赚多少钱，不论你是男性还是女性，结婚与否，你自认为是幸运的人几率差不多。
- en: So if outside events didn’t influence your perception of being lucky, could
    it be that what made you lucky was simply . . . thinking you are lucky? Your own
    attitude and optimism and sense of hope could ultimately define whether you had
    a lucky life.

- en: I was pondering the idea the next evening, as I sipped rosé at a wine tasting
    organized by a friend of my husband, a gregariously charming doctor named Michael
    Nochomovitz. The room was packed with interesting people, and toward the end of
    the evening, I met a scientist named Jonathan Stamler, who had flown in from Cleveland
    for the occasion. When I told him I was investigating luck, he immediately responded.

  zh: 第二天晚上，我在朋友组织的葡萄酒品鉴会上品着玫瑰酒，沉思着这个想法。这个朋友是我丈夫的一个非常有魅力的医生朋友，名叫迈克尔·诺乔莫维茨。房间里挤满了有趣的人，晚会快结束时，我遇到了一个名叫乔纳森·斯坦勒的科学家，他特地从克利夫兰飞过来参加活动。当我告诉他我在研究运气时，他立刻做出了反应。

    he had made related to protein function in cells. He immediately told me about

    luck played a real role in science. Not the random-chance kind of luck—a very
    different shade.

- en: “He’s brilliant, and a lot of great researchers want to work in his lab,” Stamler
    told me excitedly. “When he interviews them, he’ll talk to them a long time and
    then the last question he asks is ‘Are you lucky?’ If someone says no, they don’t
    get hired—no matter how good they are.”

    wars, he supposedly said, “I’d rather have generals who are lucky than good.”[*](83_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1)

  zh: “这是拿破仑理论吗？”我问道——注意到伟大的皇帝在打战争时，曾说过，“我宁愿有幸运的将军，也不要有能力强的将军。”[*](83_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1)
- en: Stamler smiled. “It’s subtler than that. In research it’s important to *believe*
    that you’re lucky. Any discovery requires creativity and openness and a willingness
    to try the unexpected. You need a positive attitude and a belief that you can
    find something innovative. If you don’t *think* you’re lucky, you won’t *be* lucky.”

    the right outlook was necessary to be lucky in the lab, then we were on to something
    important.

    for just about anyone. As if to prove it, a pretty young woman named Victoria

    become a certified sommelier. She had written a book about rosé wine and had a
    big reputation in some of the city’s best restaurants. Now barely in her mid-twenties,

    of international acclaim was just the start. You also had to play the proper academic

    people to believe, too. The early-morning call that came from the Swedish Academy

- en: Sipping my rosé, I realized that whether you want to be a scientist or sommelier
    or win the Nobel Prize, the answer to “Are you a lucky person?” should always
    be yes. Because the very first step to a lucky life is a positive attitude. It’s
    not mystical or preordained—it’s just that the more you believe you can make your

    and he told me about Dr. George Vaillant, a psychiatrist and professor he knew
    who spent decades contemplating the ingredients for a good life. It wasn’t theoretical—Vaillant
    oversaw the famous Harvard study that tracked hundreds of men (yes, they were
    all men in those days) from the time they were college sophomores in 1938 until
    the end of their lives. One of the longest-running studies ever done, it looked

- en: “Essentially they were trying to uncover the ingredients for a lucky life,”
    Barnaby said. “George always told me that the answer was very clear. When people

    cholesterol. The relationships didn’t have to be all hearts and flowers and Hallmark
    cards—after all, any romance has arguments and difficulties—but the definition
    of a good relationship turned out to be one where you could count on another person
    to be there for you. Relationships beyond romantic ones were important, too. An

  zh: 瓦扬特博士发现，一个人在五十岁时对人际关系的满意度，比像胆固醇等更显而易见的指标，更能预测一个人在八十岁时的健康状况。这些关系不必总是浪漫的心花怒放和贺卡上的甜言蜜语——毕竟，任何一段感情中都会有争执和困难——但好关系的定义是，你能指望另一个人在你需要时为你挺身而出。超越浪漫关系的其他关系也很重要。交朋友的能力、与人交谈的能力，以及能够让别人站在自己一边，这些都对长期的幸福和幸运有着重要的贡献。
- en: I went back and read some of the many papers and books Dr. Vaillant had written
    about the study. He had concluded that many of the things we would usually consider
    as luck makers in life—social class, parental success, religion—don’t make much
    difference. Above a certain level, intelligence doesn’t enter into the equation,
    nor does political ideology. (Though the most liberal men had the best sex lives.
    No explanation for why that would be.) What really mattered was positive emotions.

    our beliefs shaping our luck and destiny has deep spiritual and philosophical
    roots. Barnaby’s career in philanthropy had given him the extraordinary opportunity
    to meet and travel with some important religious and social leaders, including
    Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama, Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, Pastor Rick Warren,
    and Archbishop Desmond Tutu. “What each of them told me in one way or another

- en: We can make luck on both personal and global levels by changing our thinking—that
    template we have in our head. So, for example, a hundred years ago, Mahatma Gandhi

    had done a project with Mahatma Gandhi’s grandson Arun Gandhi. Now in his eighties,
    Arun is devoted to spreading the messages of love and hope that he learned from
    his grandfather when he lived with him on his ashram as a teenager. Arun believes
    what his grandfather told him then, that you need to “be the change you wish to

- en: Now that we were on that subject of creating a lucky destiny, Barnaby asked
    if I’d like to meet Deepak Chopra, the spiritualist and New Age guru, whom he
    had recently gotten to know. Barnaby and I had talked about him earlier, and I
    was intrigued that Barnaby, the serious science guy, was so inspired by some of
    Chopra’s ideas. Now Barnaby explained that Chopra’s concept of a lucky life included
    discovering your own talents and giving yourself the freedom to find your own
    path. Chopra brought the New Agey platitudes about karma down to earth by saying
    that if you try to bring happiness and success to others, you are setting the
    stage for luck to flow back to you.

  zh: 既然我们已经谈到了创造幸运命运的话题，Barnaby 询问我是否想见见 Deepak Chopra，这位精神导师和新时代的导师，他最近刚认识了这位人物。Barnaby
    和我早些时候谈过他，我很好奇 Barnaby 这位严肃的科学家为何会被 Chopra 的一些理念深深启发。接着，Barnaby 解释道，Chopra 对幸运人生的看法包括发现自己的天赋，并给予自己自由去找到自己的道路。Chopra
    通过将关于业力的新时代陈词滥调带回现实，表示如果你试图为他人带来幸福和成功，那么你就在为好运的回流铺设舞台。
- en: So on a rainy afternoon, Barnaby and I went to the downtown haven known as Deepak’s
    Homebase. We waited in his cozy office, and Deepak arrived exactly on time, looking
    relaxed and surprisingly stylish in black pants and a black shirt with a red quilted
    Patagonia vest and red sneakers. His black eyeglasses were studded with rhinestones,
    and he had a silver bracelet on one arm and a red Fitbit on the other. He looked
    like the Elton John of gurus, but he was also perceptive and thoughtful and original.
    I liked him immediately. He was completely unruffled when we asked his view on
    what it meant in a grander sense to lead a lucky life. (It’s possible that when
    you’re Deepak Chopra, “What is the meaning of life?” is the kind of question you
    get asked every day.)

  zh: 所以，在一个雨天的下午，Barnaby 和我去了市中心被称为 Deepak 的 Homebase 的圣地。我们在他舒适的办公室里等候，Deepak 准时到达，看起来很放松，穿着一条黑色裤子和一件黑色衬衫，外面搭配一件红色绗缝的
    Patagonia 背心和红色运动鞋。他的黑色眼镜上镶嵌着水钻，一只手戴着银色手链，另一只手上戴着红色的 Fitbit。他看起来像是导师中的埃尔顿·约翰，但他同样敏锐、深思熟虑且独特。我立刻喜欢上了他。当我们问他在更宏大的意义上，如何理解领导幸运人生时，他显得丝毫不慌张。（可能当你是
    Deepak Chopra时，“生命的意义是什么？”是你每天都会被问到的问题。）

    he said, “This is experience—joy, curiosity, wonder, timelessness, spontaneity,
    and playfulness. He has no sense of me and other. It is just awareness experiencing
    itself.”

    often use “flow” to describe what happens when artists or musicians (or anyone
    else) get so fully involved in a creative process that time disappears and they
    become one with their work. Deepak saw it in an even more expansive sense—“when
    you are in the moment and spontaneous and you have no regrets, no anticipation,
    no sense of a self separated from what you are doing.”

    agreed that we make ourselves (and the world) luckier when we look for the positive
    and try to replace negative thoughts with more positive, constructive ones. He
    had written before that moods follow thoughts, and it doesn’t help to indulge
    your gloom. Once you are sunk in anxiety, it’s hard to lift yourself up. If you

    and incredibly hardworking. He’d had early successes and seemed destined for a
    huge career. Some years older than me, he was ending a marriage that had been
    wrong from the start and had left his huge home in suburban Maryland for a tiny
    studio apartment in Manhattan. When I visited one evening, he perched on the edge
    of the bed (there was no place else to sit) and mentioned that one of the closets
    in his suburban house was slightly bigger than his new apartment.
