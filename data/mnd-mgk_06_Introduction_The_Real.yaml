    go any further, here is what I mean by the term: *manifesting* is defining an
    intention such that it gets embedded into our subconscious, which functions below
    the level of consciousness. By doing so, we activate brain networks associated
    with goal orientation that make an intention important, salient, or noteworthy.
    In practice, this means that regardless of whether or not that intention is present
    on a conscious level, brain mechanisms that remain focused on the goal are activated
    around the clock. Our inner intention now guides our life. By using our inner
    power to tap the vast resources of our own brain, we gradually decrease the impact
    of our external environment and begin living from our deepest intentions.'

  zh: 在流行文化中，关于显化的概念常常令人困惑，因此在我进一步阐述之前，以下是我所说的“显化”的意思：*显化*是定义一个意图，使其深入我们的潜意识，而潜意识在意识之下运作。通过这样做，我们激活与目标导向相关的大脑网络，使意图变得重要、显著或引人注目。在实践中，这意味着无论该意图是否在意识层面上存在，始终专注于目标的大脑机制都会全天候被激活。我们的内在意图现在引导着我们的生活。通过利用我们的内在力量来挖掘我们大脑的巨大资源，我们逐渐减少外部环境的影响，开始从我们最深层的意图出发生活。
- en: In fact, the first step in successfully manifesting is to separate yourself
    from the belief that there is an external source for solving your problems, and
    that this external source is what is manifesting in your life. If you want to
    lead a rich, meaningful, and prosperous life, you do not have to appease any power
    beyond yourself. You simply must believe that the source of your well-being and
    success is nothing other than the power of your own mind. The reality is that
    the same mind that creates the obstacles to the life you want is also the source
    of the intention that will make the life that you want real. This is the real
    secret.

    Still other people are afflicted by serious illnesses of the body and the mind
    and can find little relief from their suffering, which also affects their belief
    in their ability to manifest. Manifesting is not a cure or a fix for all suffering.
    Like all human activity, it can be limited by countless factors beyond our control

    quickly wounds heal to slower disease progression. Where some may believe that
    the only measure of a successful manifestation is the material results it delivers,

    world he conquers and those desires he obtains” (3.2.10). The Buddha similarly

    belief that our thoughts determine the nature of the experiences that come into
    our lives: positive thoughts bring positive experiences and negative thoughts
    bring negative ones. New Thought served as the foundation for much of the popular
    literature on manifesting in Western culture, from Napoleon Hill’s *Think and

    of cognitive neuroscience and the function of large-scale brain networks. This
    has allowed us to demonstrate that manifesting is neither a get-rich-quick scheme

    and images of the life we desire into our subconscious. We are all manifesting
    intentions in an untrained and uninformed way already, and the results are often
    haphazard, vague, and unfocused. To manifest consciously, we must learn how to
    reclaim and direct the power of our attention and understand the physiological
    mechanisms that allow us to direct that attention, as well as the obstacles and
    false beliefs that limit our power to do so. When we consciously direct our attention
    toward our desired goals, those goals become important to the brain. The way our
    goals get embedded is through a process called *value tagging*, the brain’s way
    of deciding what is significant enough to be imprinted at the deepest levels of
    the subconscious. When we practice visualization, we conjure powerful positive
    emotions, and these cue the *selective attention system* to tag the goals we desire
    as highly valuable and associate them with our reward system. Visualization works
    because, amazingly, the brain does not distinguish between an actual physical
    experience and one that is intensely imagined.

    conjure 出强大的积极情感，这些情感促使*选择性注意系统*将我们渴望的目标标记为高度有价值，并将其与我们的奖励系统联系起来。视觉化有效，因为令人惊讶的是，大脑并不区分实际的物理体验和强烈想象的体验。

    seeking opportunities to bring it about in reality, putting the full force of
    our conscious and subconscious minds behind the search. As opportunities arise,
    we notice them and respond, taking the necessary action to further our goal. We
    repeat this process of embedding our intention many, many times. Once we have
    done everything we can to manifest our goal, we must accept that is all we can
    do and no longer have attachment to the outcome. Manifestation has its own timeline
    that may or may not correspond with ours. Also, the reality is that not all of
    our goals will manifest, and often there are many reasons why that is the case,

    stuck in a painful family situation in the High Desert of California, I believed
    I was under a kind of curse that would keep my life small and at the mercy of

    a blue muumuu and looked up from the paperback she was reading. Her glasses were
    perched on her nose and held by a chain around her neck. Ruth gave me an incredibly
    radiant smile. The very nature of her smile made me feel OK: she made me feel
    safe. She told me it was her son’s shop, and she didn’t know anything about magic.
    After we spoke for about twenty minutes, Ruth indicated that she would be in town
    for six weeks that summer and offered to teach me about another type of magic
    if I came to the shop every day. Over those six weeks, Ruth fed me a bottomless
    supply of Chips Ahoy! cookies and taught me what she called “real magic”: techniques
    I could use to relax my body, tame my mind, open my heart, and clarify and visualize
    my intention. Those happy hours I spent in the back room of the magic shop sitting

    remember Ruth telling me, “Jim, be patient, be patient. You just have to be patient.
    Changing your brain takes time.”

  zh: 这是一项艰巨的工作，我常常想放弃。当我变得不耐烦时，我记得鲁思对我说：“吉姆，要耐心，要耐心。你只需要耐心。改变你的大脑需要时间。”
- en: It was hard to be patient. Especially because I didn’t know exactly what was
    happening or was going to happen. But I learned patience and I learned how to
    be present and listen. Or, at the time, I thought I had listened.

- en: Ruth’s kindness, presence, and patience changed the trajectory of my life, and
    her lessons became the basis for practically everything I went on to achieve in
    life. Ultimately, I used Ruth’s practices to get myself out of my hometown in
    the High Desert and into college, then on to medical school and later training
    as a neurosurgeon, and subsequently to an endeavor as a successful medical entrepreneur.
    But somewhere along the way I lost touch with my own heart, and this cost me gravely—not
    only financially, but in my most intimate human relationships.

  zh: 鲁思的善良、陪伴和耐心改变了我生活的轨迹，她的教诲几乎成为我在生活中取得的一切成就的基础。最终，我运用鲁思的方法使自己离开了高沙漠的家乡，进入大学，随后进入医学院，后来成为一名神经外科医生，并随后成为一名成功的医疗企业家。但在这个过程中，我与自己内心的联系渐渐疏远，这让我付出了沉重的代价——不仅仅是经济上的，还有我最亲密的人际关系。
- en: Ruth’s emphasis was unfailingly on the importance of opening the heart. Whatever
    goal I sought, whatever lofty object I desired to achieve, she always brought
    my mind back to a heartfelt connection with myself and others. And so I’ve often
    found it disheartening that this magic that is within every human being has been
    so frequently misunderstood, commodified, or presented as something only certain
    people can access. While manifesting is commonly understood in our culture as
    a way of gaining great wealth and possessions, available only to the lucky few,
    I see it as a daily practice of well-being that promotes thriving, wholeness,
    and an openhearted engagement with our world. And where the so-called prosperity
    gospel would have us believe that our desire is the primary engine of manifesting,
    I am here to tell you that it is in fact our ability to direct our attention.

  zh: 鲁思始终强调敞开心扉的重要性。无论我追求什么目标，渴望成就什么崇高的理想，她总是让我回归与自己和他人之间的真诚联系。因此，我常常发现，尽管每个人内心都拥有这种魔力，却常常被误解、商品化，或被呈现为只有某些人能够接触到的东西。在我们文化中，显现通常被理解为获取巨额财富和财物的一种方式，只有少数幸运的人才能享有，而我认为这实际上是促进健康、完整和与我们世界之间开放心灵互动的日常实践。而所谓的繁荣福音则让我们相信，我们的欲望是显现的主要动力，但我在这里告诉你，实际上是我们引导注意力的能力。
- en: 'When I first wrote *Into the Magic Shop*, I had no idea of the impact it would
    have. I had no expectation that the most popular K-pop band today, BTS, would
    use my book as inspiration for their third album, *Love Yourself: Tear*, or record
    the song “Magic Shop” inspired by the book, or that I would find myself discussing
    a movie adaptation of my story with the actor Jon Hamm, or that a sixteen-year-old
    girl would be inspired to make a phone app based on my alphabet of the heart concept.
    I honestly thought that, whether my book sold any copies or not, if it affected
    one person’s life for the better, that would be enough. Since the book’s publication,
    I’ve received thousands of messages from readers. Even now, two hundred to three
    hundred new messages arrive via email every month. Others come handwritten on
    sheets torn from yellow legal pads or in calligraphy on beautiful handmade paper.
    They come from Japan and Romania, sub-Saharan Africa, and next door to me in Northern
    California. These heartfelt responses to my story have taught me to believe with
    confidence that we are not alone, even in our deepest moments of hopelessness,
    despair, and fear. Everyone has wounds, and when we share them honestly, they
    become the means for deep connection between all of us.'

    similar. In particular, they want to know how visualization works to manifest
    their dreams. *Into the Magic Shop* was the story of my own personal journey of
    manifesting myself out of poverty, into wealth, out of it again, and, finally,
    back to the heart of compassion at the center of what Ruth taught me. It was one

    you how to harness your brain’s power to make your intention reality and explain

    the six steps I and many others follow to manifest our intentions. These are informed
    by a lifelong practice of studying the mind as a neuroscientist and as a meditation
    practitioner myself. These six steps cover every aspect of the manifesting process:
    reclaiming our power to focus our mind; clarifying what we truly want; removing
    the obstacles in our mind; embedding the intention in our subconscious; pursuing
    our goal passionately; and letting go of our attachment to the outcome. Additionally,

    a few or controlled by a secret society of one-percenters. Manifesting is a radically

    immediate physical, mental, and emotional circumstances. Accordingly, this book
    will also be filled with the stories of a great variety of people and how they
    use principles consistent with what we now know about neuroscience to manifest
    their intentions, from aspiring medical students, to neurodivergent teenagers,
    to master Polynesian navigators, to Hollywood megastars.
