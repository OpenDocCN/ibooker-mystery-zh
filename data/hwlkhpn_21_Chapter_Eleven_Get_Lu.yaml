    Africa. We stayed one night at a glorious hotel called Le Quartier Français and
    indulged in a nine-course dinner (yes, *nine* courses) in a famed restaurant called
    the Tasting Room. Over crazy good food, we held hands, stared moonily at each
    other, and talked about our amazing good luck. We still made each other laugh,
    shared the same sense of adventure (all those lions and rhinos in Africa!), and
    had been great partners in raising our two terrific sons.

  zh: 我的丈夫和我最近庆祝了一个重要的周年纪念，我们去南非度过了一次梦幻般的旅行。我们在一个叫Le Quartier Français的豪华酒店住了一晚，并在一个著名的餐厅Tasting
    Room享受了一顿九道菜的晚餐（没错，*九*道菜）。在美味的食物中，我们牵着手，深情地互相凝视，谈论着我们的好运。我们依然能让对方笑出声，分享着相同的冒险精神（那些在非洲的狮子和犀牛！），而且在抚养我们两个出色的儿子方面一直是绝佳的伙伴。

    Was it random chance that I had stumbled on the perfect guy all those years ago?

    the one person destined to be my soul mate?

  zh: 但是直到很久以后，我才开始思考*我们*到底是怎么那么幸运的。难道是因为我在多年前偶然遇到了完美的男人？在全世界七十亿人中，我是否在二十四岁时就找到了那个注定成为我灵魂伴侣的人？
- en: I wish I could be that romantic. Sure, Ron was handsome and fit, and as a doctor,
    he had a kind, caring style that I admired. But, as I suspected after all the
    research I’d been doing, our luck in love had less to do with the magic of meeting
    the right person than with the effort we had put in afterward. Nicholas Sparks
    would never sell a book if he wrote about the nitty-gritty that makes a good marriage—turning
    the other cheek when one person is snitty and turning to the other side of the
    bed when the other person is snoring. But ultimately, those are the twists and
    turns that make others think it was all just good luck.

  zh: 我希望我也能像那样浪漫。确实，罗恩英俊、身材健美，作为一名医生，他有着温柔、体贴的风格，我非常欣赏。但是，正如我在做了所有的研究之后所怀疑的那样，我们的爱情运气与遇到对的人并没有那么大关系，而是与我们事后付出的努力更多。尼古拉斯·斯帕克斯如果写一本关于成就美满婚姻的书——例如在一方发火时选择宽容、另一方打鼾时转向床的另一边——肯定卖不出。最终，这些才是那些让别人觉得一切都是好运的转折点。
- en: Most of us are realistic about what it means to be lucky in love. In the national
    survey Barnaby and I conducted, only 7 percent said that you needed to find the
    perfect person. The very largest number—a full 80 percent—said that the secret
    to being lucky in love was to pay attention to the other person’s needs as much
    as to your own.

    in importance as what you want (and your partner does the same), you both feel

- en: On his first solo album in 1985, Mick Jagger roared out a song called “Lucky
    in Love.” For the racy rock star with the wandering hips, the song was a fairly
    obvious way to boast about sexual conquest. He might be unlucky as a gambler with
    cards, horses, roulette, and craps, but he could crow that with women, it was
    easy. “Yes, I’ve got the winning touch,” he bellowed.

  zh: 1985年，米克·贾格发布了他的首张个人专辑，其中有一首歌叫做《Lucky in Love》。对于这位摇滚明星，凭借其充满诱惑的动作，这首歌显然是在炫耀他在性方面的征服。他或许在赌博中不幸——扑克、赛马、轮盘和掷骰子都不太顺，但他可以骄傲地说，在女人面前，他很容易得手。“是的，我有胜利的魔力，”他大声唱道。
- en: Jagger is one of those guys who (in the teenage parlance) get lucky on a regular
    basis. Model Jerry Hall hung around to have four children with him, even though
    she knew he was unfaithful from the beginning. He has fathered a host of children
    with half a dozen different mothers and has managed to keep the sex-symbol moniker
    well into his seventies. He’s clearly lucky at sex. And if he says he’s lucky
    at love, we believe him.

- en: But Jagger’s definition of luck isn’t shared by as many people as you may think.
    Soon after our trip to South Africa, I was on a book-tour stop in Iowa and met
    a woman named Phoebe who told me that she had been married to her high school
    sweetheart, Al, for more than forty years. The two of them had never been with
    anyone but each other. (Or so she said. I didn’t press.)

    his surprising research on the paradox of choice. (He popularized it with a book
    of that name and many TED talks.) He showed that while we think having many choices

- en: Dr. Schwartz joked about how happy he used to be years ago when his local store
    offered only one kind of jeans. Then along came choices like slim fit, easy fit,
    relaxed fit, button fly, stonewashed, acid-washed . . . and on and on. Now when
    he leaves the store, the jeans fit much better, but he feels much worse. Adding
    options increases expectations, which, he said, “produces less satisfaction with
    results, even when they’re good results.”

- en: What’s true for jeans is equally true for spouses. “If you’re looking to find
    the best, you’re never going to put in the time and effort to make what you *have*
    the best,” he told us. “It’s the Tinder effect. Why invest the time and commitment
    necessary to make a relationship grow when another option is just a swipe away?”

- en: Married for more than fifty years, Dr. Schwartz has been investing in his own
    marriage for a long time. “We’ve known each other a lot longer than that—she was
    my best friend in eighth grade. So she doesn’t like it when I talk about finding
    a spouse who is ‘good enough,’” he said with a laugh. “But really, that’s what

- en: Phoebe might similarly object to the idea that her husband is “good enough.”
    But it’s pretty clear that whatever his traits, she got lucky in love by investing
    effort and taking positive actions, including holding hands, sharing smiles, and
    visiting that cabin. Like Dr. Schwartz and his wife, Phoebe and Al met when they
    were young (in high school, in their case), and they have stayed close to their

    that we’re usually lousy at knowing how to evaluate potential mates, anyway. After
    all these years, he knows that his wife is kind, empathetic, and intelligent and
    has a fierce moral core—plus she’s the great first reader for everything he writes.
    But he didn’t focus on any of that when they met. “I was attracted to her because
    she was the first girl I ever met who loved baseball—more specifically, the New
    York Yankees. Liking the damn Yankees—what kind of basis is that for a relationship?”

    “我被她吸引是因为她是我遇到的第一个喜欢棒球的女孩——更具体地说，是喜欢纽约扬基队的女孩。喜欢该死的扬基队——这算什么关系基础？”
- en: 'Obviously, it was a good one. Or good enough. If you get your lucky-in-love
    ideas from Hollywood romantic comedies, you would probably focus the script on
    the beginning of the story: Barry and Myrna meet as kids and become best friends,

- en: So what’s the best place to meet a mate? When we talked about it later, Barnaby
    pointed out that luck comes more from the strength of the connections than from
    the power of the numbers. You’re more likely to find love among the 125 people
    at a friend’s wedding than among 20,000 fellow revelers at a football game. (If
    you want to connect to a potential partner, strike up a conversation over the

    get lucky when you pay attention to where you’ll find the best opportunities.
    And that means the best opportunities for *you*. Remember the idea Barnaby described
    earlier of ideal free distribution? Animals have a natural tendency to aggregate
    in certain areas where they’re most likely to find food and mates. In human terms,
    that’s called happy hour at a bar. They seem to know quite naturally where to
    gather relative to the resources available. If there’s an area of thick vegetation
    good for grazing, you’ll find lots of (say) deer there and fewer deer in the less-dense
    area across the field. That way there’s plenty for everybody. Once too many deer
    are gathered in the same place, some will (reasonably enough) drift to another
    spot. Once again, there’s enough for everyone.

    where all the coolest, richest, and sexiest people hang out, because that’s where
    you have the best chance of meeting a cool, rich, and sexy Mr. or Ms. Right. But
    if everyone else is gathering there, too, then you’re all competing for the same,
    well, resources. Where there is more opportunity, there is a greater density of
    competitors. If you’re the kind of person who can compete in that setting, then
    step right up and order a martini. But if you don’t stand out amid the noise,

    even if our conscious brains aren’t quite so smart. For the ABC-TV show *The Bachelor*,
    he set up experiments for the 2016 season, checking the brain activity of bachelor
    Ben and six of the women he was meeting. The tests looked at how they reacted
    to each other’s smells, the levels of oxytocin release, and physiological syncing—measured
    by heart rate variability and how closely their rhythms matched.

  zh: Zak博士的使命是证明，即使我们有时意识不到，我们的身体也能知道自己在爱情中是否幸运。为了ABC电视节目*The Bachelor*，他为2016年赛季设置了实验，检查了单身男士Ben和他遇到的六位女性的脑部活动。测试观察了他们对彼此气味的反应、催产素的释放水平以及生理同步性——通过心率变异性和他们的节奏匹配程度来衡量。
- en: The experiments were done in a spic-and-span white room stocked with complicated-looking
    machines and test tubes and beakers filled with colored liquids—a set decorator’s
    idea of a research lab. Some wondered if the experiments were as faux as the colored
    beakers. A bachelorette named Olivia emerged as the clear winner in all three
    tests—but Ben proposed to a woman named Lauren B. in the end. Dr. Zak is convinced
    the research has validity, though *The Bachelor* may have been the wrong venue
    for showing it off.

    B.的女性求婚。尽管如此，Zak博士相信这项研究是有效的，尽管*The Bachelor*节目可能不是展示它的最佳场合。
- en: The physiological responses that interest Dr. Zak definitely have a role in
    making us lucky in love. The ancient poets who thought of the heart as the source
    of love weren’t completely wrong—our bodies send us love signals. Psychologists
    say that if you want somebody to get excited about you, do something scary with
    them on a first date—go rock climbing or midnight skiing, or take a spin on a
    roller coaster. The fancy name is “misattribution of arousal,” meaning your brain
    gets mixed up about what is causing you to feel exhilarated. If you’re on a roller
    coaster and screaming in excitement, your brain may attribute some of the thrill
    to the guy who’s sitting next to you. Adventures get you aroused and make you
    feel connected to the other person.

  zh: 扎克博士感兴趣的生理反应，确实在让我们在爱情中变得幸运上扮演了重要角色。那些认为心脏是爱之源的古代诗人并不完全错——我们的身体会向我们发送爱情信号。心理学家说，如果你想让某人对你产生兴趣，在第一次约会时做一些刺激的事情——去攀岩、午夜滑雪，或者坐过山车。这个现象的专业术语是“激动的误归因”，意思是你的大脑会混淆什么事情让你感到兴奋。如果你正在坐过山车，并且因为兴奋而尖叫，你的大脑可能会把一部分兴奋归因于坐在你旁边的那个人。冒险能让你兴奋，并且让你感到与对方更有联系。

    couple can find their own lucky activities. All the neurochemicals released when
    you’re doing something new (like a museum) or challenging (like a hike) help you
