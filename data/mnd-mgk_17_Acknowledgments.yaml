    Discover the Mysteries of the Brain and the Secrets of the Heart*, it became evident
    that an important theme was the reality that one could manifest one’s intentions.
    I realized this concept was critically important, as so many readers commented
    on it and wanted to learn more. Yet there seemed to be confusion as to exactly
    what manifestation was, and many connected it with the idea that somehow the universe
    or some external force would grant them their wishes—which often related to obtaining
    wealth, power, or position—and by doing so, they would be happy. This idea has
    been promulgated by many who have promoted the concept of the Law of Attraction
    and the notion that if I just got more for myself, then I would be happy. Nothing
    could be further from the truth, and sadly, this idea reinforces a narrative that
    leads to emptiness and unhappiness, which is the opposite of creating a life of
    meaning, purpose, and, ultimately, happiness.'

  zh: 在写我的第一本书《魔法商店：神经外科医生探寻大脑奥秘与心灵秘密》的过程中，显而易见的重要主题是人们可以显现自己的意图。我意识到这个概念至关重要，因为许多读者对此评论颇多，并希望了解更多。然而，似乎对于显现究竟是什么，大家有些困惑，许多人将其与宇宙或某种外部力量会满足他们的愿望的想法联系在一起——这往往涉及获取财富、权力或地位，并且通过这种方式，他们会感到快乐。这个想法被许多宣传吸引力法则的人所传播，他们认为只要我为自己获得更多，就会幸福。事实恰恰相反，遗憾的是，这种想法强化了一个导致空虚和不快乐的叙事，这与创造有意义、有目的的生活，以及最终的幸福正好相反。
- en: As a scientist, the other aspect that I wanted to explore was the neural basis
    of how one is able to embed one’s intentions into the brain to actually allow
    for manifestation to occur. This took me on a long trek involving history, philosophy,
    psychology, and neuroscience. But even beyond this, it resulted in me exploring
    in depth the concept of self-agency and the power each of us has within us to
    change our brains, which led me back to many of the things I discussed in my first
    book. So it seems that I have come full circle.

  zh: 作为一名科学家，我想探索的另一个方面是大脑如何嵌入个人意图以实现显现的神经基础。这让我经历了一段漫长的旅程，涉及历史、哲学、心理学和神经科学。但更重要的是，这让我深入探讨了自我能动性以及我们每个人改变大脑的内在力量，这又让我回到了我在第一本书中讨论的许多内容。因此，我似乎已经回到了起点。
- en: When I first came up with the idea for this book, I discussed it with my literary
    agent, Doug Abrams at Idea Architects, who was enthusiastically supportive. We
    created a proposal that we presented to the amazing Caroline Sutton, editor-in-chief
    of Avery (an imprint of Penguin Random House), the publisher of my first book.
    She was immediately on board. Her support, encouragement, and guidance has been
    greatly appreciated.

  zh: 当我第一次提出这本书的构想时，我与我的文学代理人Doug Abrams讨论了这个想法，他在Idea Architects工作，非常支持我们。我们创建了一个提案，并向我第一本书的出版商、Avery出版社的总编辑Caroline
    Sutton展示了。她立刻表示支持。她的支持、鼓励和指导让我十分感激。
- en: Of course, translating a concept into a narrative is not simple or straightforward.
    One of the first things I did was a deep dive into the science behind the topic,
    reading many books and hundreds of articles. My dear friend Monica Bucci, MD,
    kindly offered to read through the books and articles as well, and helped me by
    organizing and summarizing the literature and giving me much appreciated input
    and advice as the project progressed. Next, Idea Architects was kind enough to
    recommend Alexander Nemser to collaborate with me, not only in regard to organizing
    my thoughts but also to assist in turning what could have been a somewhat dry
    topic into a compelling narrative, intertwining the science with stories that
    I had shared with him. In the process, Alexander has become a close friend.

  zh: 当然，将一个概念转化为叙事并不是简单或直接的。一开始我做的事情之一就是深入研究该主题背后的科学，阅读了许多书籍和数百篇文章。我亲爱的朋友Monica Bucci博士友善地提出阅读这些书籍和文章，并在项目进行过程中帮助我整理和总结文献，并提供了非常宝贵的意见和建议。接下来，Idea
    Architects很高兴地推荐了Alexander Nemser与我合作，不仅帮助我组织思路，还协助将原本可能略显枯燥的主题转变为引人入胜的叙事，将科学与我分享的故事交织在一起。在这个过程中，Alexander也成为了我的好朋友。
- en: I would also like to thank my extraordinary wife and life partner, Masha, whose
    support I try not to take for granted. My wife has always remained supportive
    of my endeavors in promoting the power of compassion to change lives. For this
    I am forever grateful.
