    shorthand that luck doesn’t fall from the sky—but we understood that if you want
    to be literal, even that truth isn’t 100 percent accurate. A woman named Ann Hodges
    was at her home in Sylacauga, Alabama, one day in 1954, napping on the couch under
    a big quilt, when a hunk of black rock crashed through the ceiling and hit her
    on the thigh. With that (unlucky) burst from the sky, she became the only confirmed
    person in history to have been hit by a meteorite.

  zh: 在谈到创造自己好运的必要性时，我和巴纳比常常用一种简短的说法：好运不会从天而降——但我们明白，如果你想要字面上的解释，即使这个事实也并非百分之百准确。1954年，一位名叫安·霍奇斯（Ann
    Hodges）的女性在阿拉巴马州西拉考加的家中，正躺在沙发上盖着大被子打盹时，一块黑色岩石从天花板坠下，砸在她的大腿上。由于这一（不幸的）天外飞石，她成为历史上唯一确认被陨石砸中的人。
- en: You probably shouldn’t spend a lot of time worrying about meteorite strikes
    since “it’s more likely you get hit by a tornado and a bolt of lightning and a
    hurricane all at the same time,” Florida State College astronomer Michael Reynolds
    said about that remarkable hit. And yet we do worry. Scientists say an asteroid
    that smashed into the earth 66 million years ago led to a change in climate that
    caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. It was long ago and rare, but who knows—if
    there’s an asteroid strike every 66 million years, another may be due tomorrow.[*](36_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1)

  zh: 你可能不应该花太多时间担心陨石撞击，因为“你被龙卷风、闪电和飓风同时击中的可能性更大，”佛罗里达州立大学天文学家迈克尔·雷诺兹（Michael Reynolds）在谈到这次惊人的撞击时说道。尽管如此，我们还是会担心。科学家表示，6600万年前撞击地球的小行星引发了气候变化，导致恐龙灭绝。那是久远而罕见的事件，但谁知道呢——如果每66百万年就有一次陨石撞击，也许明天就会发生另一次。[*](36_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1)
- en: Now that I was thinking of luck as a combination of chance, talent, and hard
    work, I had decided that the wisest approach was to put chance aside and focus
    on the other two—the ones you could control. But I also understood that the unpredicted
    and the unforeseen can seem overwhelming. If you’re going to be hit by a meteorite,
    everything else seems kind of unimportant.

    better perspective on randomness. We’ve all had situations that seem like crazy
    coincidence—you’re traveling in a remote location and run into someone you know,

    club Leicester City was given a 5,000–1 chance of winning the championship of

    *你疯了吗？根本不可能发生。*
- en: The Premier League is big and powerful, with no draft or salary caps, and the
    same four teams have won the championship for the previous twenty years. Little
    underfunded Leicester City had lost so many games the previous season that they
    barely escaped being tossed out of the league altogether. The closest they had
    come to a championship was finishing second in the 1928–29 season. They spent

    research later and found out that Barnaby was completely right. Most studies show
    that genetic factors play only a small part in obesity, and lifestyle is more
    important than anything else. Research out of the Harvard School of Public Health
    shows that even if you have the genes associated with obesity, what you eat and
    how much you exercise will have a greater influence on your shape than your genetics.
    Where you live has a role in obesity, too. In some states (topped by Alabama),
    obesity is over 35 percent, while in Colorado, the perennially leanest state,
    it’s more like 20 percent. But if you live in one of the fattest states and eat
    fruit and vegetables and go for daily runs, you’ll easily beat the odds. In fact,

  zh: 我吃了那块香蕉面包。由于这个话题让我很感兴趣，之后我做了一些额外的研究，发现 Barnaby 完全是对的。大多数研究表明，遗传因素对肥胖的影响很小，生活方式比其他任何因素都重要。哈佛公共卫生学院的研究显示，即使你有肥胖基因，饮食和运动量对你的身材的影响也会远远超过遗传因素。你所在的地方也会影响肥胖。在一些州（如阿拉巴马州），肥胖率超过35%，而在科罗拉多州——这个常年保持最瘦的州——大约是20%。但如果你生活在这些肥胖率较高的州，仍然坚持吃水果蔬菜并每天跑步，你完全有可能打破这些统计数据。事实上，整体的统计数据根本不适用于你。

    surprised me by telling me that when his first daughter, Mandarin, was born, he
    wanted her to share the bed with her parents. His wife, Michelle, thought it was
    a terrible idea. She told Barnaby that co-sleeping babies are five times more
    likely to die than those who are put safely in their own cribs. Some are crushed
    when parents roll over on them, and others suffocate in sheets and blankets or
    get wedged in the sides of beds. There is also a clear connection between the
    devastation of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and co-sleeping. One comprehensive
    review showed that 69 percent of babies who died of SIDS slept in their parents’
    bed. The statistics were pretty clear—the safest place for a baby is in a crib.

    blocks of tickets through more than a hundred different retailers. It kept the

    a big deal, but it doubles the possible combinations to 14 million.) And even
    if you win, you always run the risk of having to share the big bucks with other
    ticket holders who (randomly) picked the right combination. In major lotteries,
    like the national Mega Millions drawings, it would be impossible to print the
    necessary number of tickets, no matter how many retailers you had on your side.

    percent chance that someone will win—and the same person winning twice in a few
    months isn’t as unusual as it may sound. Mathematicians refer to it as the law
    of big numbers, and it gives us a new way of thinking about odds. Some years ago
    a woman in New Jersey won the state lottery twice in four months. Even more amazing
    than Michelle’s groceries, right? Reporters said she had beaten odds of 1 in 17
    trillion. But then two statisticians at Purdue University, Drs. Stephen Samuels
    and George McCabe, begged to differ. They pointed out that those odds were based
    on a given person buying a single ticket for both lotteries and winning each time.
    But out of the millions and millions of people buying hundreds of millions of

    Samuels博士和George McCabe博士提出了不同的看法。他们指出，这个概率是基于某个人仅购买一张彩票并且每次都中奖的假设。但是在数百万购买彩票的人中，几亿张彩票中，某个地方出现双重获胜者的几率则大不相同。1/17万亿？不，应该是1/30。

    I was supposed to be flying to the Bahamas to give a speech. But . . . *Make your
    opportunities! Be the statistic you want to be!* I paid a big fee to change my
    flight to the next day (and still got there in time for the speech). I prepared
    for the meeting and gave it my all.

  zh: 一周后，我接到了电话，告知最终竞争者已缩小至四人，做决定的人可以在下周三与我会面。巧合的是，我原本应该飞往巴哈马演讲。不过……*创造你的机会！成为你想要成为的统计数字！*我支付了一大笔费用，将航班改签到第二天（并且仍然及时到达演讲现场）。我为会议做了准备，并全力以赴。
- en: As I write this, I don’t yet know whether I got the project—but it doesn’t matter.
    I did everything I could to shift the odds in my favor. One way or another, I
    worked to make the luck happen. And when you look at your life, knowing you’ve
    pushed and believed and tried to change the odds is what makes you feel lucky.

  zh: 当我写下这段话时，我还不知道自己是否得到了这个项目——但这并不重要。我已经尽我所能地改变几率，使它对我有利。不管怎样，我努力让运气发生。当你回顾自己的人生，知道你曾经努力过、相信过、尝试过去改变几率，这才是让你感到幸运的原因。
- en: I chatted about that with a woman named Christy Clark, who lives in Boulder,
    Colorado. Or she *used* to live in Boulder. When we spoke, she told me that the
    very next week, she and her husband and their first-grade daughter were moving
    full-time to Paris.

  zh: 我和一位名叫Christy Clark的女士聊了聊，她住在科罗拉多州的博尔德。或者说，她*曾经*住在博尔德。当我们交谈时，她告诉我，下周，她和她的丈夫以及他们的一年级女儿将全家搬到巴黎。
- en: “How fabulous!” I said.

  zh: 在个人冒险方面，这是我听过的最大胆的举动之一。
- en: Intrigued by Paris since she was a kid in New Jersey, Christy married her high
    school sweetheart, Cliff, and they visited the beautiful city on their honeymoon
    and again with their baby daughter. They took vacations there and eventually bought
    and renovated a gorgeous apartment near St. Germain des Prés. It started to seem
    right to her to have a new adventure.

  zh: 自从在新泽西州还是个孩子时就对巴黎充满好奇，Christy嫁给了她的高中恋人Cliff，他们在蜜月期间和之后带着女儿再次访问了这座美丽的城市。他们在那里度假，最终买下并翻新了一套位于圣日耳曼区附近的华丽公寓。对她来说，开始有了冒险的感觉。
- en: Moving to Paris with a young child when you don’t speak French sounds pretty
    dicey. But Christy had done everything she could to make sure it would work.

  zh: 在不懂法语的情况下带着小孩搬到巴黎听起来相当冒险。但Christy已尽一切努力确保这一切能够顺利进行。
- en: “We have a wonderful life in Boulder, but my heart sings when I’m in Paris,”
    she said.

  zh: 她说：“我们在博尔德的生活非常美好，但当我身处巴黎时，我的内心充满了喜悦。”
- en: As a psychotherapist in private practice, she regularly told couples to make
    luck (and love) by trying things they’d never done before. “Always ask yourself
    the question of why you’re doing something,” she said. “Am I doing it because
    it’s familiar? Change is hard and scary, but think of all the luck you can make
    if you’re willing to feel a little uncomfortable.”

  zh: 作为一名私人执业的心理治疗师，她经常鼓励情侣们尝试一些从未做过的事情来创造好运（和爱）。她说：“时常问自己做某事的原因是什么。是因为它让你感到熟悉吗？改变是困难和可怕的，但如果你愿意感到一点不适，想想你可以创造多少好运。”
- en: For days after I spoke to Christy, I couldn’t stop thinking about her. I imagined
    her wandering through the Louvre and eating pain au chocolat and playing with
    her daughter in the Luxembourg Gardens. Had she increased her odds for a lucky
    life? Maybe some statistic shows how many people are happy in Boulder versus Paris,
    and no doubt some mathematician could work out the odds for marital bliss if you
    move to your dream city instead of staying put. But if so, I would respectfully
    tell Christy to ignore all of them. There are good days and bad ones in any life,
    and you make luck by trying to have more of one than the other. Maybe doing what
    makes your heart sing is one way to become the statistic you want to be.

  zh: 在与Christy交谈后的好几天里，我一直无法停止思考她。我想象她漫步于卢浮宫，品尝着巧克力面包，在卢森堡花园里和女儿玩耍。她是否增加了拥有幸运生活的几率？也许某些统计数据显示博尔德和巴黎有多少人感到幸福，毫无疑问，某个数学家可以算出如果你搬到梦想中的城市而不是待在原地，婚姻幸福的几率。但如果真是这样，我会恭敬地告诉Christy忽略所有这些数据。任何生活中都有好日子和坏日子，而你通过努力让好运更多一些而不是坏运更多，来创造自己的幸运。也许做那些让你的心灵歌唱的事，正是成为你想成为的那种统计数字的一种方式。
