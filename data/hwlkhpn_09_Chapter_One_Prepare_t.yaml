- en: Barnaby’s Luck Lab at the Institute for Advanced Study was tucked away amid
    the beautiful wooded fields of Princeton, New Jersey—a perfect place for thinking
    big thoughts about the science of making luck. As we took a walk together through
    the peaceful grounds one morning, Barnaby told me that Albert Einstein wandered
    these same tree-lined paths while mulling over his famous theories. Our new ideas
    might not disrupt the theory of relativity, but we hoped they would change the
    way people thought about luck—and the possibilities for their own futures.

  zh: 巴纳比的运气实验室位于新泽西州普林斯顿的美丽林地间——一个思考关于创造运气科学的宏大思想的完美地点。一天早晨，我们一起在宁静的校园中散步，巴纳比告诉我，阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦曾在这些同样的林荫小道上徘徊，思考他的著名理论。我们的新理念可能不会颠覆相对论，但我们希望它们能够改变人们对运气的看法——以及他们对自己未来的可能性。
- en: It had rained hard the previous night, and the sun hadn’t yet dried out the
    wet ground. Scooting around a puddle, I told Barnaby that writing my previous
    book *The Gratitude Diaries* had taught me that we have more control over our
    own happiness than we sometimes realize. I was delighted that the book had inspired
    so many people to lead happier lives, and I had a feeling that understanding how
    to make yourself lucky—under any circumstances—could have a similar effect.

  zh: 前一晚大雨滂沱，阳光尚未晒干湿漉漉的地面。我绕过一个水坑，告诉巴纳比，写作我之前的书《感恩日记》让我明白，我们对自己的幸福掌控比我们有时意识到的更多。我很高兴这本书激励了许多人过上更快乐的生活，我有预感，理解如何在任何情况下让自己变得幸运，可能会产生类似的效果。
- en: Barnaby nodded. “If you’re driven to make your life a little better and wonder
    why things don’t always go your way, our new approach will let you claim the luck
    that should be yours.”

  zh: 巴纳比点点头。“如果你渴望让生活变得更好，且常常困惑为何事情不总是如你所愿，我们的新方法将让你掌控本该属于你的运气。”
- en: We both agreed that luck isn’t the same as random chance. If you flip a coin
    ten times to determine your future, you are relying on chance—and most people
    would agree that’s pretty silly. If you talk to people, prepare yourself, look
    for opportunity, and then jump on the unexpected events that might (randomly)
    appear, you are making luck. And that’s what we all need to do.

  zh: 我们都同意，运气不同于随机机会。如果你掷硬币十次来决定你的未来，你是在依赖机会——大多数人都会同意这非常愚蠢。如果你与人交谈，做好准备，寻找机会，然后抓住那些可能（随机）出现的意外事件，那么你就在创造运气。这就是我们所有人需要做的。

    where and how to look for it,” Barnaby said.

  zh: “运气不是零和博弈。如果你知道在哪里以及如何寻找，运气对每个人来说都足够多，”巴纳比说。
- en: Barnaby thought the evidence was pretty clear that luck is not passive—it requires
    action, and many events that may seem like random chance are not so random after
    all. He was convinced that by understanding the underlying dynamics of luck, you
    can gain control over aspects of your life that once seemed to depend on chance,
    fate, or the phases of the moon. We would work together using insights and recent
    discoveries in psychology, behavioral economics, mathematics, and neuroscience
    to develop a new way of understanding luck.

  zh: 巴纳比认为，证据非常明确：运气不是被动的——它需要行动，许多看似随机的事件实际上并不那么随机。他坚信，通过理解运气的潜在动态，你可以掌控曾经看似依赖运气、命运或月相的生活各个方面。我们将一起运用心理学、行为经济学、数学和神经科学的见解与最新发现，开发一种全新的运气理解方式。

- en: The Luck Lab was the right place to do this, since the Institute for Advanced
    Study, where Barnaby has an academic appointment, is famous as a font for big
    ideas. Over the years, it has attracted geniuses from around the world—and it’s
    fun to drive around local streets named after many of them. Along with Einstein,
    the great mathematician and philosopher Kurt Gödel was a professor there, and
    so was the early computer scientist and game theory pioneer John von Neumann.
    Renowned theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, also known for his work
    building the first atomic bomb at Los Alamos National Laboratory, was a longtime
    director.

  zh: 幸运实验室是进行这项研究的理想场所，因为巴纳比在高等研究所的学术职位让他能够接触到伟大的思想来源。多年来，这里吸引了来自世界各地的天才——而且开车绕过当地的街道时，你会看到许多街道都以他们的名字命名。除了爱因斯坦，伟大的数学家和哲学家库尔特·哥德尔也是这里的教授，早期的计算机科学家和博弈论先驱约翰·冯·诺依曼也曾在此任教。著名的理论物理学家J·罗伯特·奥本海默，也因其在洛斯阿拉莫斯国家实验室制造第一颗原子弹的工作而闻名，是这里的长期主任。
- en: And Barnaby and I felt we were the right team to tackle the project. We had
    very different backgrounds and life experiences. I’ve had a successful career
    as a journalist, magazine editor, and TV producer in the New York City area and
    raised two terrific sons with my handsome doctor-husband. Barnaby grew up in Alaska
    and was homeschooled until he started college—at which point he launched into
    academic and career experiences that took him around the globe. He became a top
    executive at a major foundation that gives away $100 million a year. A quirky
    and original thinker, he knows more people than anybody I’ve ever met. He recently
    settled in New York City with his wife, Michelle, and their two very young and
    adorable daughters—though “settled” is never the right word for him.

- en: We hoped our research in luck would be powerful and game-changing and give people
    a new view of their own lives and experiences. Barnaby had already been coming
    up with strategies about opportunity and risk and effort and how these affect
    your ability to transform your future. It was all very erudite and heady, and

- en: As a practical schedule, Barnaby would escape to this ivoriest of towers every
    Monday and Tuesday to make conceptual models and try to develop theories of luck
    that worked across all contexts—whether you were trying to get a job, find a mate,
    or survive as a species in the evolutionary sweepstakes. On Wednesdays we would
    meet and talk them through. Along the way, I would find the academics, entrepreneurs,
    and celebrities who could illustrate the points and help us both see how people
    could wittingly or not make luck happen for themselves.

    amazed and baffled. I was starting to agree that luck isn’t a magical and mystical
    force that falls from the sky—it’s something that we can (at least partly) create
    for ourselves. That’s fairly stunning to realize, since most of us sit back and
    hope for good luck when we really should be taking the right steps to make it
    happen. The sharp-tongued Australian novelist Christina Stead noted in 1938 that
    “a self-made man is one who believes in luck and sends his son to Oxford.” In
    other words, chance plays a role in life, but it’s not everything. The foundations
    for luck are set by our own actions—what we try, whom we talk to, how fast we
    decide to run for the train.

  zh: 第二天当我把这个故事告诉巴纳比时，我感到既惊讶又困惑。我开始同意一个观点：幸运不是从天而降的神秘力量——它是我们自己（至少部分）可以创造的东西。意识到这一点真是令人震惊，因为大多数人只是坐等好运降临，而我们真正应该做的是采取正确的步骤去让好运发生。尖锐的澳大利亚女作家克里斯蒂娜·斯泰德在1938年指出：“自制的人是相信运气的人，他把儿子送到牛津。”换句话说，机会在生活中确实起作用，但它不是一切。幸运的基础是通过我们自己的行动建立的——我们尝试什么，和谁交谈，我们决定多快去追赶那趟火车。
- en: If luck is all around us, waiting to be found, then we have to stop walking
    right by it or whizzing past in our SUVs. Lucky occurrences usually aren’t as
    haphazard as they may first appear. It’s true that fortune is not fairly distributed
    and some options are beyond your control. I had been born in the United States
    to middle-class parents who wanted me to advance, and in the history of the world,
    that counted as an enormous, unbelievable privilege. But no matter how you start

    Fully 82 percent of people believed that they had some or great influence over

    they couldn’t change their luck. So our belief that you could make luck happen

    a lottery is just a game that raises money and hopes. You buy a ticket, and then

    and tried to tease out the elements that made them lucky. Certain traits—like
    smarts, determination, energy, and original thinking—got repeated over and over.
    Chance sometimes played a role—good timing and all that—but it never stood alone.

  zh: 受过去天才幽灵的启发，我们谈论了我们认识的成功人士，并试图揭示使他们幸运的元素。某些特质——比如聪明、决心、活力和原创性思维——一再被提及。有时运气也起了作用——时机合适之类的——但它从未单独存在。
- en: In addition to our national survey, Barnaby had sent questions about luck to
    several hundred Rhodes scholars, and we started looking over the answers. Many
    people described an unexpected event that had influenced their life—a trip abroad
    that resulted in a job, a foundation that offered a grant, an investor they sat
    next to at a dinner who helped them start a company.

  zh: 除了我们的全国性调查，巴纳比还向数百位罗德奖学金获得者发出了关于运气的问题，我们开始审阅这些答案。许多人描述了影响他们生活的意外事件——一次国外旅行带来了一个工作机会，一个提供资助的基金会，一位在晚宴上坐在他们旁边的投资者帮助他们创办了公司。

- en: But what seemed like serendipity often had an identifiable basis if you followed
    it back a few steps. The person who met the investor at dinner, for example, had
    an exciting idea and talked about it to everybody who would listen. A colleague
    who was impressed by his concept had invited him to the dinner. Lucky? Yes. Random
    chance? Not really. I started to see the role people had in making their own luck,
    and a simple formulation suddenly became clear to me.

  zh: 但看似机缘巧合的事情，如果你追溯几步，往往有可识别的基础。例如，那位在晚宴上遇到投资者的人，拥有一个令人兴奋的想法，并向所有愿意听的人谈论它。一位对他构思印象深刻的同事邀请他参加了这场晚宴。幸运？是的。偶然的机会？不完全是。我开始看到人们在创造自己好运中的作用，一个简单的公式突然清晰地出现在我脑海中。

- en: Hard work is open to everyone, and so, surprisingly, is talent. You don’t have
    to be able to sing like Beyoncé or act like Meryl Streep to be lucky (though it
    doesn’t hurt), since talent also involves elements that all of us can develop—an
    openness to opportunity, a willingness to take risks, an ability to think differently
    from others, and even a dose of optimism. With the right approach, you can make
    the lucky combination of chance, talent, and hard work happen for yourself—and
    get luckier in every part of life.

  zh: 努力对每个人都开放，惊人的是，才华也是如此。你不必像碧昂丝那样能歌善舞，或者像梅丽尔·斯特里普那样演技出众才能算幸运（虽然这样当然不错），因为才华还包括我们所有人都能培养的元素——对机会的开放态度、愿意冒险的精神、与众不同的思维方式，甚至是一丝乐观。只要方法得当，你也可以为自己创造机会、才华和努力的幸运组合——让自己在生活的各个方面变得更加幸运。
- en: My lucky Friday the thirteenth showed me the power of these basic principles.
    Careful preparation and a willingness to try (*I will run for that earlier train!*)
    both fit into the hard-work element of luck. My decision to take a positive approach
    by talking to the waitress, thanking her, and being friendly was one of the skills
    that helps lead to luck (and cupcakes).

- en: I started to think of the three elements of luck as being like one of those
    old-fashioned slot machines where you pull the handle and three items have to
    line up in a row. People get addicted to waiting for the three cherries, for example,
    to appear next to one another. Psychologists call it “variable ratio reinforcement”—you
    don’t know when you’ll get the reward, so you keep trying, expecting it to appear
    at the next pull of the handle. I’m much too logical to find any appeal in slot
    machines—but I might be won over if I knew I could line up two of the cherries
    myself.

  zh: 我开始把运气的三个元素想象成那种老式的老虎机，你拉下拉杆，三个物品必须排成一行。例如，人们会沉迷于等待三个樱桃并排出现。心理学家称之为“可变比率强化”——你不知道什么时候会获得奖励，所以你会继续尝试，期待它出现在下一次拉杆时。我实在太理性了，对老虎机没有任何吸引力——但如果我知道我可以自己排成两个樱桃，也许我会被说服。
- en: And that’s what happens in real life. If you want a payoff of any kind—a new
    job, a new love—you don’t have to wait for completely random luck to get those
    cherries lined up. The talent and hard-work cherries are under your control. You
    can learn how to put them directly in the slots—and then you’re two-thirds on
    your way to a lucky life.
