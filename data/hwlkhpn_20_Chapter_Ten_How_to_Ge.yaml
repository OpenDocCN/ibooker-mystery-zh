- en: Barnaby regularly insisted that our principles of luck had to be “robust”—a
    word that always made me think of a chubby, red-cheeked toddler. But in science
    lingo, it means the rules can hold up in most circumstances. The term is adapted
    from computer programmers who use it to ensure that their coding will work even
    if there are errors during input—and you probably don’t want to get too deeply
    into this lingo, because then you find out about fuzz testing, which involves
    putting in random data and seeing if it crashes the whole program.

  zh: 巴纳比常常坚持认为我们的幸运原则必须是“稳健的”——这个词总让我想起一个胖乎乎、红扑扑的小孩。但在科学术语中，这意味着这些规则在大多数情况下都能奏效。这个术语源自计算机程序员，程序员用它来确保即使在输入过程中出现错误，他们的代码依然能正常运行——你大概不想太深入这个术语，因为你会了解模糊测试，它涉及输入随机数据，看看程序是否崩溃。
- en: We were pretty sure that our program for making luck wasn’t fuzzy at all, and
    the principles—from being attentive to zigging when others zagged—were definitely
    robust. They could get you through anything.

    work in everyday situations. Making yourself lucky in a theoretical sense is nice—but
    it’s a lot better if you can get lucky in the areas that really count, like love,
    work, and family.

- en: Barnaby told me a funny story about the go-getters who apply to be first-year
    analysts at Goldman Sachs. Most are at the top of their game and the top of their
    class (at an Ivy League school, preferably), and with so many high-level people
    competing, any little edge can make a difference. So they write carefully crafted
    cover letters, deliberate about whether their résumé should be in Helvetica or
    Arial font, and look for the bon mot that will make them stand out.

  zh: 巴纳比给我讲了一个有趣的故事，关于那些申请成为高盛一年前分析师的积极进取者。大多数人都在自己领域处于顶尖水平，并且是班里的佼佼者（最好是常春藤盟校的学生），由于如此多的高层次竞争者，任何一点优势都可能产生影响。所以他们精心编写求职信，仔细考虑简历应该使用Helvetica还是Arial字体，寻找能让自己脱颖而出的精彩语言。
- en: One year, the Goldman Sachs managing director who was overseeing recruiting
    piled all the résumés of potential analysts on his desk, then divided them into
    two smaller stacks. He deliberated for a moment—and then tossed one of the stacks
    into the wastebasket.

    have to be lucky in this business,” he said. Then pointing to the résumés still
    on his desk, he added, “We might as well pick from the lucky ones.”

    really true or just Wall Street legend.

- en: The story got us thinking. If you’re trying to make your own luck (as we’ve
    been describing all along), how can you possibly make sure that your résumé ends
    up in the pile that stays on the desk? Once we’d posed the question to ourselves,
    we spent some time batting it around. Had we finally hit on an example where the
    randomness, which you can’t control, was the operating force in luck, well beyond
    the other elements that you can control, like talent and hard work?

- en: Aha! The managing director at Goldman Sachs was right that you’re going to need
    luck to get a job—but remember that the luck we’ve been describing comes at the
    intersection of chance, talent, and hard work. The whimsical decision to toss
    away half the résumés is a perfect example of random chance. If you’re in the
    wrong pile, there’s nothing you can do. And while you can’t remove random chance
    from life (unless you do have those magical powers), you have to be prepared to
    work around it. You can’t always anticipate the unexpected, but you can focus
    on elements that *are* in your control, and thus make chance less . . . chancy.

  zh: 啊哈！高盛的管理董事会说得对，要找到一份工作确实需要运气——但记住，我们所描述的运气是在机会、才华和努力工作的交汇点上。随意丢掉一半简历的决定就是随机机会的完美例子。如果你在错误的堆里，你什么也做不了。而且，虽然你不能从生活中消除随机性（除非你真的拥有魔法力量），但你必须准备好绕过它。你不能总是预见到意外，但你可以专注于那些*你能控制*的元素，从而让运气变得不那么……具有随机性。
- en: So let’s say you’re applying for that job at Goldman Sachs. The trick is to
    make sure that your résumé ends up in a *third* stack—a small selection that the

- en: Now, it may seem like we’re working backward here—because when you’re applying,
    you can’t possibly know that the managing director is going to do something so
    random. But whether you’re in the year of the lucky-versus-unlucky résumé piles
    or not, it’s a good bet that a basic résumé, even one set in Helvetica and accompanied
    by a brilliant cover letter, won’t be enough to get you hired. Standard techniques
    rarely work in a hypercompetitive environment. You need something that will make
    you stand out from the beginning so that your résumé isn’t in either of the stacks
    on his deck.

  zh: 现在，看起来我们好像在倒着推理——因为在申请工作时，你根本无法知道管理董事会会做出如此随机的决定。但是，不管你是否在幸运和不幸运的简历堆中，一个基本的简历，即便是用
    Helvetica 字体排版并附有一封出色的求职信，也不足以让你被录用。在高度竞争的环境中，常规的技巧往往不起作用。你需要一些东西来让你从一开始就脱颖而出，这样你的简历才不会在他桌上的任何一堆中。
- en: One approach is to imagine the person who would definitely be lucky in this
    situation. You can, for example, figure that if some top-level executive had a
    child applying for the Goldman Sachs job, he’d call the CEO directly and make
    sure that his prodigy’s résumé was at least seen. Instead of stomping around and
    complaining about how unfair it all is, you can figure out how that example applies
    to you. Assuming your family ties lean more toward plumbers and accountants and
    sales reps than investment bankers, what’s the best next step?

- en: Clearly you need to find somebody else who can pick up the phone and make that
    call for you. And that’s not as hard as it sounds. Don’t worry about what your
    mom and dad can (or can’t) do for you. Remember that sociologists have shown that

- en: Barnaby had come across an executive coach named Don Asher who has written a
    dozen books on how to get a job, so we tracked him down to get his advice on the

- en: Asher told us about one client who was in retail sales and wanted to break into
    the fashion business. He told her to ask everyone she encountered if they knew
    anyone in the field. “She was in the gym with her personal trainer, Helga, and

- en: We called two other career coaches, and it turned out that the Helga story wasn’t
    an anomaly. People such as hairdressers and personal trainers—whose professions

- en: One of the strongest of the weak ties often turns out to be college alumni connections.
    It’s hard to say exactly why the fact that you attended Notre Dame rather than
    Penn State should make someone want to talk with you—but it works. Psychologists
    have shown over and over that people form tribal allegiances over often insignificant
    ties. Give half a group red T-shirts and the other half blue ones, and all of
    a sudden people are fiercely loyal to their colormates. They’ll be more likely
    to lend them money and cooperate with them in games.

    and Kirke so defined their characters that it was impossible to think of anybody

- en: “We help create networks for people who don’t have them,” Julian told me. Minority
    students at small schools, for example, might not have any obvious route to Wall
    Street since investment banks usually offer jobs to students from only a few select
    colleges. But SEO makes the network much wider. You provide the hard work and
    determination—and they’ll make sure you get the opportunities to connect with
    the right people.[*](61_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_3) When Julian and I spoke, SEO
    had students from 105 different colleges about to start in summer internships.
    That’s a large number of schools. SEO was opening lucky doors for a lot of people—and
    they expected that 80 percent of the interns would get full-time offers.

  zh: “我们帮助那些没有网络的人建立联系，”Julian告诉我。例如，小型学校的少数族裔学生可能没有明显的途径进入华尔街，因为投资银行通常只向少数几所大学的学生提供职位。但是，SEO让这个网络变得更广泛。你提供努力和决心——他们会确保你有机会与正确的人建立联系。[*](61_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_3)
    当Julian和我交谈时，SEO有来自105所不同大学的学生即将开始暑期实习。这是一个非常大的学校数量。SEO为许多人打开了幸运的大门——他们预计80%的实习生会获得全职录用。
- en: Julian pointed out that to make luck in your career, you need to do more than
    study and work hard. That might have paid off in grades K–12, but in the real
    world, it’s no longer enough. Instead of keeping your head down and expecting
    the work to speak for itself, you need to find mentors and advisors and sponsors
    who will help you advance. Julian told me that the SEO teams stay with the students
    after they get the internships to help them understand how to ascend within the
    company—“because your network becomes your net worth.”

  zh: Julian指出，要在职业生涯中创造幸运，你需要做的不仅仅是学习和努力工作。这种做法在K–12学段或许有效，但在现实世界中已经不再足够。你不能只是埋头工作，指望努力本身能够证明一切，你需要找到导师、顾问和支持者，帮助你向上发展。Julian告诉我，SEO团队在学生获得实习机会后仍会与他们保持联系，帮助他们了解如何在公司内晋升——“因为你的网络就是你的财富。”

    owe it to yourself to develop and take advantage of them. You have to give yourself

    opportunity and thought you might be interested,’” David said with a smile. “You
    have just come back from lunch and weren’t thinking about changing jobs, and now

- en: From long experience, David has found that people typically fall into one of
    three categories. He described the first group as people who “throw up a hundred
    defenses right away as to why it won’t work.” Sometimes the problem is real life
    getting in the way of opportunity (if your teenager is a junior in high school,
    you may not want to move), and sometimes they’re just uncomfortable with change.

- en: People in the second group are also slightly wary and show it by “digging in
    and asking a lot of questions—who they’ll report to, why the last guy got fired,
    what their responsibilities would be. They want all the information before deciding
    whether to even have the conversation.” Then there’s the third group—“the people
    who listen and say, ‘Great. I wasn’t expecting your call, but I’m in.’”

- en: David finds the initial response to be a good measure of how the person will
    do going forward. The naysayers in the first group usually won’t work out even
    if they change their mind and decide to pursue the opportunity. Those in the second
    group who ask a lot of questions may be thoughtful and analytic—and David appreciates
    that. But he’s also careful to see if they’re the kind of people who will continue
    to throw obstacles in the way and find reasons not to go ahead. Those in the third
    group are most likely to be successful at recognizing new and lucky opportunities—but
    he wants to be sure that they’re not reckless.

    “And then the craziest thing—I got a call from Citizen watch company asking if
    I’d teach their salesmen how to sell watches. I was thirty years old and didn’t
    know a thing about watches.” One of the top executives had seen him in action
    as a fund raiser, knew he was persuasive and good on his feet, and recommended
    him. “So I went to the Acapulco Princess in Mexico for five days with my wife
    and did sales training for a $75 million watch company. Courageous? Okay, yes.
    Lucky that it came my way and I didn’t screw it up? Definitely. It was always

    其中一位高管曾见过他作为筹款人的表现，知道他善于说服且临场反应敏捷，于是推荐了他。“所以我和妻子一起去了墨西哥的阿卡普尔科公主酒店待了五天，为一家市值 7500
    万美元的手表公司做销售培训。勇敢吗？好吧，是的。幸运的是这机会找到了我，我也没有搞砸？绝对是。它一直提醒我，当你有机会时，就应该抓住它。”

    wanted to be an original who took big risks and looked very lucky when they paid
    off. When she was at Harvard, she hadn’t felt inspired by her classes and didn’t
    see where her degree would lead.

  zh: “是的，扎克伯格、比尔·盖茨和马特·达蒙都是哈佛辍学生，他们提高了整体数据的平均水平，”坎塔尔说。她喜欢将自己看作是他们那类人，她也想成为一个原创者，敢于冒大风险，并在风险兑现时看起来非常幸运。当她在哈佛时，她对课堂内容没有感觉，也看不出自己的学位能带她走向何方。
- en: “My parents were panicked, but I tried to talk them through and ask what they
    were worried about,” she said. “My mom pointed out that I wouldn’t be able to
    get a traditional job in investment banking or consulting without a college degree—but
    I said I didn’t want one. She also worried about what would happen if I eventually
    wanted to go into politics. I said that my generation would like to see someone
    who had done something interesting rather than just what’s expected.”

    Newton, Massachusetts, she took Chinese, got obsessed with origami, and played

    asked to devise her own curriculum. The school said no. So she wrote to the deans
    of the Ivy League schools where she had applied and said she wanted to quit her
    AP classes and do an independent study project for the rest of the year. What
    did they think of that? Most of them responded that it would be just fine. Rebecca
    spent the rest of senior year outside the classroom. “It was the best academic

    Sometimes it pays off big, and sometimes it doesn’t. Yet failing isn’t always
    a bad thing. Barnaby told me about a conversation he had with Naveen Jain, the
    entrepreneur who founded a company called InfoSpace in the late 1990s. It was
    briefly one of the largest internet companies in the country—making Jain worth
    some $8 billion. Then came the dot-com crash and a series of lawsuits, and suddenly
    his stake was more in the $200 million range.

    failure is not a political option. The last 1 percent of the risk abatement adds
    99 percent of the cost,” he said. A private company can make the unmanned rocket
    “good enough”—then buy private insurance to cover the cost if something goes wrong.

    So, for example, Barnaby didn’t drop out of college like Kantar did, but he did
    switch universities several times, moving from Harvard to Cornell to a year of
    research at Oxford. (He actually planned it all, wanting to work with the world-renowned
    ornithology professors at each.) Later, he wanted to win a Rhodes scholarship
    to return to Oxford and needed to be endorsed by his school. Cornell initially
    said they couldn’t support him because he didn’t have enough credits on their
    campus. Barnaby went higher and higher in the administration, finally banging
    on the president’s door. He figures that he contacted close to fifty people in
    various capacities to get support for his application.
